# Quickstart

Get started with smolagents in just a few minutes! This guide will show you how to create and run your first agent.

## Installation

Install smolagents with pip:

```bash
pip install smolagents
```

For additional features, you can install optional dependencies:
```bash
pip install smolagents[toolkit]  # Includes default tools like web search
```

## Create Your First Agent

Here's a minimal example to create and run an agent:

```python
from smolagents import CodeAgent, InferenceClientModel

# Initialize a model (using Hugging Face Inference API)
model = InferenceClientModel()  # Uses a default model

# Create an agent with no tools
agent = CodeAgent(tools=[], model=model)

# Run the agent with a task
result = agent.run("Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10")
print(result)
```

That's it! Your agent will use Python code to solve the task and return the result.

## Adding Tools

Let's make our agent more capable by adding some tools:

```python
from smolagents import CodeAgent, InferenceClientModel

# Initialize with default tools (requires smolagents[toolkit])
model = InferenceClientModel()
agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[],  # Empty list since we'll use default tools
    model=model,
    add_base_tools=True  # This adds web search and other default tools
)

# Now the agent can search the web!
result = agent.run("What is the current weather in Paris?")
print(result)
```

## Using Different Models

You can use various models with your agent:

```python
# Using a specific model from Hugging Face
model = InferenceClientModel(model_id="meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf")

# Using OpenAI/Anthropic (requires smolagents[litellm])
from smolagents import LiteLLMModel
model = LiteLLMModel(model_id="gpt-4")

# Using local models (requires smolagents[transformers])
from smolagents import TransformersModel
model = TransformersModel(model_id="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf")
```
