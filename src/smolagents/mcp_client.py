    Note: tools can only be accessed after the connection has been started with the
        `connect()` method, done during the init. If you don't use the context manager
        we strongly encourage to use "try ... finally" to ensure the connection is cleaned up.

    Args:
        server_parameters (StdioServerParameters | dict[str, Any] | list[StdioServerParameters | dict[str, Any]]):
            Configuration parameters to connect to the MCP server. Can be a list if you want to connect multiple MCPs at once.

            - An instance of `mcp.StdioServerParameters` for connecting a Stdio MCP server via standard input/output using a subprocess.

            - A `dict` with at least:
              - "url": URL of the server.
              - "transport": Transport protocol to use, one of:
                - "streamable-http": Streamable HTTP transport (default).
                - "sse": Legacy HTTP+SSE transport (deprecated).
        adapter_kwargs (dict[str, Any], optional):
            Additional keyword arguments to be passed directly to `MCPAdapt`.

    Example:
        ```python
        # fully managed context manager + stdio
        with MCPClient(...) as tools:
            # tools are now available

        # context manager + Streamable HTTP transport:
        with MCPClient({"url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp", "transport": "streamable-http"}) as tools:
            # tools are now available

        # manually manage the connection via the mcp_client object:
        try:
            mcp_client = MCPClient(...)
            tools = mcp_client.get_tools()

            # use your tools here.
        finally:
            mcp_client.disconnect()
        ```
