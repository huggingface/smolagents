To rewrite this in the form $(x + b)^2 + c$, we complete the square:\n\n1. Start by rewriting $x^2 + 2.6x$ as a perfect square trinomial.\n2. The formula to complete the square is $(x + \\frac{a}{2})^2 = x^2 + ax + (\\frac{a}{2})^2$. For our quadratic, $a = 2.6$.\n3. Calculate $(\\frac{2.6}{2})^2 = 1.3^2 = 1.69$.\n4. Thus, $x^2 + 2.6x = (x + 1.3)^2 - 1.69$.\n5. Substitute this back into the original expression:\n   \\[(x + 1.3)^2 - 1.69 + 3.6\\]\n6.
