To fit the sphere perfectly inside the cube, the cube's internal space should have length equal to the sphere's diameter.\n3. Therefore, the side length of the cube should be 6 inches.\n4. The volume of the cube is given by the formula V = side^3, which results in 6^3. \n\nI propose using this reasoning to calculate the volume and verify.

The diameter of the sphere is 6 inches (double the radius), which should also be equal to the side length of the smallest possible cube enclosing it. Consequently, the side of the cube is 6 inches and its volume is calculated by the formula V = side^3. Therefore, the cube's volume is 6^3 = 216 cubic inches.
