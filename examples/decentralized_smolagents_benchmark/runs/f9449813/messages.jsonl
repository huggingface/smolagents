Therefore, number of 5-pound bags needed = 8.25 / 5 = 1.65\n   - Since you can't buy a fraction of a bag, round up to whole number: 2 bags.\n\n**Final Conclusion**: Since each bag is 5 pounds and we've calculated that 8.25 pounds are needed, you will actually need 2 full bags.

Therefore, number of 5-pound bags needed = 8.25 / 5 = 1.65\n   - Since you can't buy a fraction of a bag, round up to whole number: 2 bags.\n\n**Final Conclusion**: Since each bag is 5 pounds and we've calculated that 8.25 pounds are needed, you will actually need 2 full bags.
