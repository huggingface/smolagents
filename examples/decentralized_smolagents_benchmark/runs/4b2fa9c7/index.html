You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show &quot;Pick That Ping-Pong&quot;. In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.</div></div><div class="msg"><div class="meta"><span class="sender">WebSearchAgent</span><span class="type">channel_created</span><span class="thread"># riddle-analysis-d6050004</span><div>2025-09-01T17:41:25.362Z</div><span class="pill">CodeAgent</span><span class="pill">DeepResearchAgent</span><span class="pill">DocumentReaderAgent</span></div><div class="content"><div class="section"><div><b>type:</b> channel_created</div><div><b>channel_id:</b> riddle-analysis-d6050004</div><div><b>subject:</b> riddle-analysis</div><div><b>description:</b> Discussion of the best strategy for solving the Pick That Ping-Pong riddle</div><div><b>creator:</b> WebSearchAgent</div><div><b>initial_members:</b> <code class="code">[

The random firing of pistons makes it advantageous to pick one of the balls that starts on the platform.

Given that there are three pistons and the three initial balls on the platform, choosing one of these three gives you the best odds since they are the first to be ejected. Arguably, ball number 3 has slightly better odds due to its position.

I will proceed to propose this choice as the final answer, but I encourage others to review and provide feedback or alternative thoughts!</div></div><div class="msg"><div class="meta"><span class="sender">system</span><span class="type">channel_created</span><span class="thread"># riddle-analysis-d6050004</span><div>2025-09-01T17:41:30.569Z</div><span class="pill">@all</span></div><div class="content"><div class="section"><div><b>type:</b> channel_created</div><div><b>channel_id:</b> riddle-analysis-d6050004</div><div><b>description:</b> Deep analysis and data examination</div><div><b>creator:</b> WebSearchAgent</div><div><b>auto_created:</b> True</div><div><b>initial_members:</b> <code class="code">[]</code></div></div></div></div><div class="msg"><div class="meta"><span class="sender">WebSearchAgent</span><span class="type">channel_message</span><span class="thread"># riddle-analysis-d6050004</span><div>2025-09-01T17:41:30.575Z</div><span class="pill">@all</span></div><div class="content">Hello team! We&#x27;ve got an interesting riddle to tackle involving a series of pistons and ping-pong balls. The game involves selecting one ball from a set of 100, which are processed on a platform controlled by pistons. The goal is to choose the ball most likely to be ejected, thus winning the grand prize.

Here&#x27;s the breakdown:
- 100 numbered balls are arranged from 1 to 100.
- The first three balls (1, 2, and 3) advance to the platform.
- A piston randomly ejects a ball from either the first, second or third position.
- When a ball is ejected, other balls on the platform adjust based on the platform&#x27;s rules, and new balls from the ramp fill the vacant spots.

We need to determine which ball to choose to maximize the chance of being ejected. Let&#x27;s analyze the pattern of movement and decision strategy. Any insights on the most strategic choice?</div></div><div class="msg"><div class="meta"><span class="sender">DocumentReaderAgent</span><span class="type">poll</span><span class="thread"># main</span><div>2025-09-01T17:41:31.547Z</div><span class="pill">@all</span></div><div class="content"><div class="section"><div><b>Question:</b> Should this be our final answer to the user?</div><div><b>Proposal:</b> 3

By choosing ball number 3, we increase our chances due to its placement on the initial platform.

**Supporting Evidence:**
Ball number 1 consistently holds the highest probability of being ejected. Its initial position ensures that it is constantly exposed to the pistons firing according to the game&#x27;s mechanism. </div></div></div></div></div><div class="msg"><div class="meta"><span class="sender">WebSearchAgent</span><span class="type">poll</span><span class="thread"># main</span><div>2025-09-01T17:42:25.311Z</div><span class="pill">@all</span></div><div class="content"><div class="section"><div><b>Question:</b> Should this be our final answer to the user?</div><div><b>Proposal:</b> 1

**Supporting Evidence:**
Ball number 1 has the highest probability of being ejected because it is constantly at risk of being removed in every scenario. When piston 1 fires, it ejects immediately; when piston 2 or 3 fire, ball 1 is released by default. Therefore, ball number 1 will be ejected first whenever it is on the platform.</div><div class="section"><div><b>poll_id:</b> df6f7dba-e37f-49f7-9a5a-dd8e60ad6c3e</div><div><b>options:</b> <code class="code">[
