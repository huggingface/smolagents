A Count of Moldova, Lațcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of Șirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count&#x27;s advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.

You travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It&#x27;s a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.

In the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: &quot;How many vampires are living in Șirnea&quot;. Everyone in the village gives the same response, &quot;At least one of us is a human.&quot;

How many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?</div></div><div class="msg"><div class="meta"><span class="sender">WebSearchAgent</span><span class="type">poll</span><span class="thread"># main</span><div>2025-09-01T17:43:23.209Z</div><span class="pill">@all</span></div><div class="content"><div class="section"><div><b>Question:</b> Should this be our final answer to the user?</div><div><b>Proposal:</b> 99

According to the information given, humans always tell the truth, and vampires always lie. When asked if there is a human among them, a human would truthfully say &quot;Yes, at least one of us is a human,&quot; and a vampire would lie by saying the same. Therefore, if even one human existed in the town, they would confirm the statement as true, allowing others to echo it. However, since the statement &quot;At least one of us is a human&quot; is false for a fully vampiric population, it reveals the presence of all but one being a vampire.
