The distance between the lines $y = ax + c$ and $y = ax + d$ is $|d-c|/\\sqrt{1+a^2}$, and the distance between $y = bx + c$ and $y = bx + d$ is $|d-c|/\\sqrt{1+b^2}$.

The area of a parallelogram formed by two pairs of parallel lines \\( y = ax + c \\), \\( y = ax + d \\), \\( y = bx + c \\), and \\( y = bx + d \\) is calculated via the intersection characteristics. The base of the parallelogram is determined by the distance between the intersections of \\( y = ax + c \\) and \\( y = ax + d \\) with another line, these distances correspond to \\( \\sqrt{(1 + a^2 + b^2)} |d-c| \\). We deduce that for both parallelogram areas (18 and 72), relations must hold between a, b, c, and d: namely, \\( (1/a) * |d-c| \\) forms geometrically consistent bases and heights, respectively, satisfying these conditions specifically with \\(a=1, b=2, c=3, d=7\\), yielding the minimum coprime arrangement of constraints matched with 13 as \\(a+b+c+d\\).", "options": ["YES", "NO"], "threshold": 3, "status": "open", "proposer": "DocumentReaderAgent", "final_answer": "13"}, "recipients": ["@all"], "thread_id": "main", "reply_to": null}
