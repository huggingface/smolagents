The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.\n\nIf Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?", "recipients": ["@all"], "thread_id": "main", "reply_to": null}

One box must contain at least 2 coins.\n2. One box must contain 6 more coins than another.\n3. The total number of coins is 30.\n\nLet's assume the boxes contain x, y, and z coins, where z = x + 6 (because one box must have 6 more coins than another). We also know:\n\n- x + y + z = 30, and\n- z = x + 6.\n\nSubstituting z = x + 6 into the sum equation:\n\nx + y + (x + 6) = 30 simplifies to 2x + y + 6 = 30, or y = 24 - 2x.\n\nNow, we need to consider only valid non-negative integer solutions for x, y, and z (with z >= x + 6, and all values summing to 30).\nIf Bob's guess for each box is x, y, and x+6 (corresponding box assignments based on x, y, and z), Bob should guess less than or equal to the contents in every trial to maximize his earnings. Since guessing higher gives him zero tokens from that box, always guessing at least one less guarantees earnings from those coins.\n\nBy solving, we find x = 8, y = 8, z = 14. If Bob guesses (8, 8, 14), he earns 8000 from the smallest box, 8000 from the middle, and 6000 from the biggest (since guess equaling what's inside isn't advantageous).\n\nThus, Bob wins a minimum of 22 coins (8000 + 8000 + 6000 = $22,000).", "options": ["YES", "NO"], "threshold": 3, "status": "open", "proposer": "DocumentReaderAgent", "final_answer": "22000"}, "recipients": ["@all"], "thread_id": "main", "reply_to": null}
