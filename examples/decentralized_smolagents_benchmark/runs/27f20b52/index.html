The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host&#x27;s coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob&#x27;s guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.

**Supporting Evidence:**
To determine the optimal strategy, consider the constraints: 
1. One box must contain at least 2 coins.
2. One box must contain 6 more coins than another.
3. The total number of coins is 30.

Let&#x27;s assume the boxes contain x, y, and z coins, where z = x + 6 (because one box must have 6 more coins than another). We also know:

- x + y + z = 30, and
- z = x + 6.

Substituting z = x + 6 into the sum equation:

x + y + (x + 6) = 30 simplifies to 2x + y + 6 = 30, or y = 24 - 2x.

Now, we need to consider only valid non-negative integer solutions for x, y, and z (with z &gt;= x + 6, and all values summing to 30).
If Bob&#x27;s guess for each box is x, y, and x+6 (corresponding box assignments based on x, y, and z), Bob should guess less than or equal to the contents in every trial to maximize his earnings. Since guessing higher gives him zero tokens from that box, always guessing at least one less guarantees earnings from those coins.

By solving, we find x = 8, y = 8, z = 14. If Bob guesses (8, 8, 14), he earns 8000 from the smallest box, 8000 from the middle, and 6000 from the biggest (since guess equaling what&#x27;s inside isn&#x27;t advantageous).

Thus, Bob wins a minimum of 22 coins (8000 + 8000 + 6000 = $22,000).</div><div class="section"><div><b>poll_id:</b> cd8b093f-837d-4e4b-84fc-9f325f4890b6</div><div><b>options:</b> <code class="code">[

Starting from our initial assumption:

1. Suppose we denote the boxes as A, B, and C.
   - A contains x coins.
   - B contains x + 6 coins.
   - C will then contain 30 - x - (x + 6) = 24 - 2x coins.

2. The constraints require that every box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must have 6 more coins than another.
   - **Box A**: Contains at least 2 coins, so x ≥ 2.
   - **Box C**: Contains at least 2 coins, thus 24 - 2x ≥ 2.
   - Simplify to find valid x range from these inequalities.

3. Calculate the exact distribution that meets these constraints and maximize Bob&#x27;s guess.

Can you verify this and refine any assumptions?</div></div><div class="msg"><div class="meta"><span class="sender">WebSearchAgent</span><span class="type">poll</span><span class="thread"># main</span><div>2025-09-01T17:44:51.047Z</div><span class="pill">@all</span></div><div class="content"><div class="section"><div><b>Question:</b> Should this be our final answer to the user?</div><div><b>Proposal:</b> $18,000

**Supporting Evidence:**
After breaking down the constraints: 
1. Total sum of coins is 30.
2. Box A has at least 2 coins.
3. Box C should have at least 2 coins.
4. One box is 6 coins more than another.
   
Using permutations (x, x+6, 30-2x-6) allowed us to define: 
- x as at least 2, and 24 - 2x as at least 2. Solving results in integer solutions 8, 8+6, 30-2(8)-6 -&gt; {x, x+6,16-2(x+6)}. 
This consistent with constraints, leads to values like (8, 14, 8).

Using an optimal strategy means Bob places maximum reward and guessing as minimum per box unwinnable.
