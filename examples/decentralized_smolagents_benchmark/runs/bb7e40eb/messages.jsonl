The common tangent line has the form \\(y = mx + c\\). For this line to be tangent to the circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\), the distance from the origin to the line \\(y = mx + c\\), given by \\( \\frac{|c|}{\\sqrt{1+m^2}} \\), must equal its radius which is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). This gives the relation \\(c = \\pm \\sqrt{2(1+m^2)}\\).\\n\\nSimultaneously, if the line is tangent to the parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\), it satisfies the condition \\(c = \\frac{2}{m}\\). Equating gives \\(\\pm\\sqrt{2(1+m^2)} = \\frac{2}{m}\\). Solving for \\(m\\),\\n\\n\\(2(1+m^2) = \\left(\\frac{2}{m}\\right)^2\\)\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\n- For the positive slope: \\((4m^2 - 2) = 0\\) which gives \\(m = \\pm 1\\). Then plug back to find \\(c = \\pm \\sqrt{4} = \\pm 2\\); therefore, the tangents \\(y = x + 2\\) and \\(y = -x + 2\\).\\n- For the negative case: solving the full quadratic \\(4m^2 = 4\\) results in \\(x = 2\\), thus \\(m = 0.5\\) giving another pair \\(y = x + 4, y = -x + 4\\).\\n\\nThe intersection points (A, B, C, D) thus form quadrilateral ABCD. Calculate coordinates using simultaneous equations of lines with parabola or circle to find these four intersection points:\\n\\n- Lines y = x + 2 and y = -x + 2\\n- Lines y = x + 4, y = -x + 4\\n\\nUsing these calculated coordinates: the quadrilateral AB + AD + BC + CD is formed with coordinates of vertices A = (0,0), B = (2,4), C = (0,0), D = (2,-4), respectively.
