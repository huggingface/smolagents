Since the pistons randomly fire, each ball on the platform initially has an equal chance of 1/3 to be ejected first. However, ball number 3 is strategically advantageous because it is the last to be ejected if the initial firing targets balls 1 or 2. This increases its likelihood of remaining longer on the platform, thus maximizing the chances you have for being the selected ball upon piston firing.
