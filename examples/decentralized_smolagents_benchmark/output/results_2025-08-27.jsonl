Since the pistons randomly fire, each ball on the platform initially has an equal chance of 1/3 to be ejected first. However, ball number 3 is strategically advantageous because it is the last to be ejected if the initial firing targets balls 1 or 2. This increases its likelihood of remaining longer on the platform, thus maximizing the chances you have for being the selected ball upon piston firing.

The reliable sources such as the Royal Society and IUCr confirm the year as 1992. However, there was a voter suggesting the year might be 2006. Given this inconsistency, a fact-checking channel was created and a request for further investigation was sent out. \n\nAs a result of this ongoing review, if you are confident in the initial answer (1992) as supported by reliable sources, maintain the previous vote.
