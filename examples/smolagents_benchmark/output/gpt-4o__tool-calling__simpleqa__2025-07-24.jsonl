It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- web_search: Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The search query to perform.'}, 'filter_year': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optionally restrict results to a certain year', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- visit_webpage: Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url of the webpage to visit.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['unicodedata', 'time', 're', 'random', 'math', 'statistics', 'itertools', 'queue', 'stat', 'datetime', 'collections'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you.

The Damage stat dictates how much damage the weapon does. The Damage stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D / E:   * A is Physical Damage * B is Magical Damage * C is Fire Damage * D is Lightning Damage * E is Dark Damage   Each weapon has one or more physical damage types:   * Striking * Slashing * Thrusting   Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types.  See [Weakness](/weakness) for physical reduction, [Resistance](/resistance) for elemental reduction. |\n| **Aux Effect:** | The Aux Effect stat dictates how effective the weapon will be at causing the effect. The Aux Effect stats for a weapon are A / B:   * A is [Poison](/poison) Effect * B is [Bleed](/bleed) Effect |\n| **Counter Strength:** | [Damage multiplier](/counter) when hitting an enemy that is performing an action such as attacking. Value of 100 means no extra damage. |\n| **Poise Damage:** | The ability of the weapon to break the [poise](/poise) of an enemy. |\n| **Stats Needed:** | The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively.  The stats required for a weapon are A / B / C / D:   * A is the [Strength](/strength) required * B is the [Dexterity](/dexterity) required * C is the [Intelligence](/intelligence) required * D is the [Faith](/faith) required   Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon,  while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon.  Also keep in mind that your character gains a 100% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing  the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 14 Strength can wield a Great Club (Requires 28 Strength)  properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (14 x 2 = 28) |\n| **Stat Bonuses:** | The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat.  This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill).  See [Scaling](/scaling) for more information.

|\n\nThe **Argentine general election of 1946**, the last for which only men were enfranchised, was held on 24 February. Voters chose both the President and their legislators.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=1946_Argentine_general_election&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Background\")]\n\nConservative rule, maintained through electoral fraud despite a moderate record, was brought to an end in a [June 1943 coup d'\u00e9tat](/wiki/Infamous_Decade#1943_coup \"Infamous Decade\"). Barking \"orders of the day\" every morning on the radio, the new regime enjoyed little approval. The devastating [1944 San Juan earthquake](/wiki/1944_San_Juan_earthquake \"1944 San Juan earthquake\") presented an opportunity to regain lost goodwill and the regime moved quickly, involving the private sector through nationwide fund-raising, entrusted to the Labor Minister, [Juan Per\u00f3n](/wiki/Juan_Per%C3%B3n \"Juan Per\u00f3n\"). Per\u00f3n enlisted celebrities for the effort, among which was a radio matinee star of middling talent, [Eva Duarte](/wiki/Eva_Duarte_de_Per%C3%B3n \"Eva Duarte de Per\u00f3n\"), who introduced herself to the Labor Minister by remarking that \"nothing's missing, except a touch of [Atkinson's](/wiki/Hair_tonic \"Hair tonic\")\". The effort's success and the rise of his ally, [Edelmiro Farrell](/wiki/Edelmiro_Farrell \"Edelmiro Farrell\"), within the junta, led to Per\u00f3n's appointment as vice-president, which he leveraged in support of Argentina's struggling labor unions, particularly the [CGT](/wiki/General_Confederation_of_Labour_(Argentina) \"General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Marcha_de_la_Constituci%C3%B3n_19-sep-1945.jpg/250px-Marcha_de_la_Constituci%C3%B3n_19-sep-1945.jpg)](/wiki/File:Marcha_de_la_Constituci%C3%B3n_19-sep-1945.jpg)\n\nSupporters of the Democratic Union gather on [May Avenue](/wiki/Avenida_de_Mayo \"Avenida de Mayo\") in Buenos Aires. This 1945 alliance of conservatives and leftists was tenuously united only by its opposition to Per\u00f3n.\n\nPer\u00f3n's sudden clout led to growing rivalry among his junta colleagues, who had him arrested on October 9, a surprise move outdone by CGT leaders like retail workers' leader [\u00c1ngel Borlenghi](/wiki/%C3%81ngel_Borlenghi \"\u00c1ngel Borlenghi\"), the slaughterhouses' [Cipriano Reyes](/wiki/Cipriano_Reyes \"Cipriano Reyes\") and Eva Duarte, herself. Organizing a mass (and, at times, violent) demonstration for his release on the [Plaza de Mayo](/wiki/Plaza_de_Mayo \"Plaza de Mayo\"), their October 17, 1945, mobilization marked a turning point in Argentine history: the creation of the [Peronist](/wiki/Peronist \"Peronist\") movement. Capitulating to the political winds, the junta bestowed presidential powers on Per\u00f3n, who initiated his program of mass nationalizations of institutions such as the universities and [Central Bank](/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Argentina \"Central Bank of Argentina\"). Calling elections for February 1946, Per\u00f3n's opposition hastily arranged an alliance, the [Democratic Union](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uni%C3%B3n_Democr%C3%A1tica \"es:Uni\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica\"). Many in the centrist [Radical Civic Union](/wiki/Radical_Civic_Union \"Radical Civic Union\") were steadfastly opposed to this *ad hoc* union with conservatives and the left, an intrinsic burden compounded by a [white paper](/wiki/White_paper \"White paper\") scathingly critical of Per\u00f3n released by the [U.S.](/wiki/Argentina-United_States_relations \"Argentina-United States relations\") Ambassador, [Spruille Braden](/wiki/Spruille_Braden \"Spruille Braden\"). The report, accusing Per\u00f3n of [fascist](/wiki/Fascist \"Fascist\") ties, allowed him to marginalize the Democratic Union (and their distinguished, though disastrously-named nominees, [Jos\u00e9 Tamborini](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Tamborini \"Jos\u00e9 Tamborini\") and [Enrique Mosca](/wiki/Enrique_Mosca \"Enrique Mosca\") \u2013 the \"tambourine and the fly\"). He quickly reframed the argument as one between \"Per\u00f3n or Braden\", making this his rallying cry and winning the 1946 elections handily.\n\nCandidates for

I'm pretty certain that over the years some bits will have gotten lost, so I need to know what exactly is in a complete set to see what's missing from mine. There's only so much I've been able to glean from the info on the box/what I've found online. So, can someone either point me in the right direction of a complete itinerary, or can someone with a full set tell me:\n\n* How many figures of each type of monster are there?\n* How many of each kind of tile (pit trap etc) are there?\n* How many of each piece of furniture are there?\n\nPretty please and thank you.\n\n**Edit:** This is the UK 1989 edition.\n\nRead more\n\n Share \n\nShare\n\nPublic\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\nTop Posts\n---------\n\n---\n\n* [Reddit\n\n  reReddit: Top posts of September 24, 2012\n\n  ---](https://www.reddit.com/posts/2012/september-24-1/)\n* [Reddit\n\n  reReddit: Top posts of September 2012\n\n  ---](https://www.reddit.com/posts/2012/september/)\n* [Reddit\n\n  reReddit: Top posts of 2012\n\n  ---](https://www.reddit.com/posts/2012/)\n\n#### See this post in...\n\nReddit App\n\n[Open](https://reddit.app.link/?%24android_deeplink_path=reddit%2Fr%2Fboardgames%2Fcomments%2F10e52d%2Fheroquest_whats_in_a_fullcomplete_box%2F&%24deeplink_path=%2Fr%2Fboardgames%2Fcomments%2F10e52d%2Fheroquest_whats_in_a_fullcomplete_box%2F&%24og_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fboardgames%2Fcomments%2F10e52d%2Fheroquest_whats_in_a_fullcomplete_box%2F&base_url=%2Fr%2Fboardgames%2Fcomments%2F10e52d%2Fheroquest_whats_in_a_fullcomplete_box%2F&mweb_loid=t2_1u89tkr181&mweb_loid_created=1753377480550&referrer_domain=www.reddit.com&referrer_url=%2F&campaign=no_amp_test&utm_name=no_amp_test&channel=xpromo&utm_source=xpromo&feature=web3x&utm_medium=web3x&keyword=no_amp&utm_term=no_amp&tags=app_selector_modal_xpromo_post&utm_content=app_selector_modal)\n\n![Browser](https://www.redditstatic.com/shreddit/assets/browsers/chrome.png)\n\nBrowser\n\nContinue"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Tool call call_9RL2ZegMYmv4MeWzi9a7Hf7I: calling 'final_answer' with arguments: {'answer': '3'}"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_9RL2ZegMYmv4MeWzi9a7Hf7I', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'final_answer', 'arguments': {'answer': '3'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n3"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}], "start_time": 1753384668.9066029, "end_time": "2025-07-24 21:17:54", "token_counts": {"input_tokens": 8918, "output_tokens": 114, "total_tokens": 9032}}

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- web_search: Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The search query to perform.'}, 'filter_year': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optionally restrict results to a certain year', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- visit_webpage: Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url of the webpage to visit.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code. It can be used to perform calculations.\n    Takes inputs: {'code': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The code snippet to evaluate. All variables used in this snippet must be defined in this same snippet, else you will get an error. This code can only import the following python libraries: ['unicodedata', 'time', 're', 'random', 'math', 'statistics', 'itertools', 'queue', 'stat', 'datetime', 'collections'].\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nFor how many days was Frida Kahlo's first solo exhibit held?

cultures\n\nFrida Kahlo was born in Mexico City on 6th July 1907, the daughter of German photographer Carl Wilhelm Kahlo and Mexican painter Mathilde Calder\u00f3n.\n\nFrida Kahlo spent the vast majority of her life at her family home, La Casa Azul (The Blue House), in the metropolitan district of Coyoac\u00e1n.\n\nJust like her three sisters and the two half-sisters from her father\u2019s previous marriage, Frida Kahlo rejected her mother\u2019s strictly Catholic lifestyle. This was a repeated source of tensions within the family.\n\n![Frida Kahlo Zeitstrahl](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/2176903_orig.png?h=c2189fda&itok=GFPnj2w8)\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/Frida%20Kahlo_%20June%2015_%201919%20-%20Guillermo%20Kahlo.jpg?h=d8ca3bec&itok=C5uNh0wG)\n\n1914\u20131925 \n\n### Frida Kahlo\u2019s formative years\n\nHer health problems began in 1914. A congenital deformity of her spine kept Frida bound to her bed for much of her childhood.\n\nIn 1922, Frida Kahlo was one of the first girls to be admitted to the renowned Escuela Nacional Preperatoria school, where she prepared to study medicine.\n\nFollowing her serious accident in September 1925, she began to train with Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez, a commercial artist who was friendly with her father.\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/3ad47fde60f793f07ea6f4d025f21a22.jpg?h=6439c975&itok=wZ4JTohd)\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/Frida-Kahlo---Guillermo-Kahlo.jpg?h=0e958177&itok=E41jTwI-)\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/youngfrida-10.jpg?h=cf6609a4&itok=DZn04nsH)\n\n1925 \n\n### **A serious accident shapes her life**\n\nWhen she was 18 years old, Frida suffered a severe injury while she was on a bus journey with her boyfriend Alejandro G\u00f3mez Arias.\n\nWhen the bus collided with a tram, her legs were broken in many places, while her back and pelvis were pierced by an iron handrail. These injuries caused her great pain and forced her to spend recurring periods in hospital throughout her life.\n\nFrida Kahlo had to wear a whole-body plaster cast or a corset for many weeks after the accident. Later, she did manage to walk again, contrary to her doctors\u2019 expectations \u2013 but she had to give up her dreams of studying medicine.\n\n![1929---The-Bus---Frida-Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1929---The-Bus---Frida-Kahlo.jpg?h=93d577f6&itok=OtGaOg_6)  \n\n1929 The Bus\n\n![frida kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/9ff2dafadb68fca845443a89eb14cd6d.jpg?h=24654252&itok=7wWne3s2)\n\n1926 \n\n### \u201cI paint myself because I spend a lot of time alone\u201d\n\nDuring her long period of recovery, she began to paint and to draw. Frida Kahlo painted her first self-portrait in September 1926. This was followed by many other images of herself, in which she reflected her current emotional and physical circumstances.\n\nFrida repeatedly stated that \u201cI paint myself because I spend a lot of time alone, and because I am the subject I know best\u201d to explain her self-portraits.\u00a0\n\nFollowing Alejandro\u2019s increasing withdrawal from her life, Frida\u2019s relationship with her first boyfriend finally came to an end in 1928.\n\n![1926 - Self-portrait-in-a-velvet-dress - Frida-Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1926---Self-portrait-in-a-velvet-dress---Frida-Kahlo.jpg?h=dfc3751c&itok=S16ZPxEf)  \n\n1926 - Self portrait in a velvet dress\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/fridakahloin45vintagephotos-18.jpg?h=cc7c1108&itok=4nS0PGUJ)\n\n1928 \n\n### **The painter Diego Rivera \u2013 more than just one passion**\n\nThe 22-year-old Frida Kahlo met 41-year-old Mexican painter Diego Rivera through an acquaintance. Not only did they both share a passion for painting, they also shared the same political opinions.\n\nRivera\u2019s large-scale revolutionary wall paintings in public spaces \u2013 the Murales \u2013 gained him a great deal of attention and international fame at a very early age.\n\nRivera immortalised Frida in a portrait within the wall painting \u201cBallade of the Revolution\u201d, which he created for the Ministry of Education in Mexico City during this period. Frida joined the Communist Party of Mexico at about this time.\n\n![1931 - Frieda and Diego Rivera](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1931---Frieda-and-Diego-Rivera---Frida-Kahlo.jpg?h=bfdb6bea&itok=7TanE43y)  \n\n1931 - Frieda and Diego Rivera\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/deliveryService.jpg?h=08358d88&itok=gf-FsHND)\n\n1929 \n\n### **Frida Kahlo gets married in Coyoac\u00e1n**\n\nFrida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, 20 years her senior, were married in Coyoac\u00e1n on 21st August 1929.\u00a0\n\nThis was the third marriage for Diego Rivera.\n\nAt the Palacio Nacional, Rivera was starting to work on the wall painting that depicted the history of the Mexican people.\n\nRivera was excluded from the Mexican communist party because of his criticism of Soviet communism and its party leader, Josef Stalin. As a result, Frida left the party too.\n\n![Frida Kahlo & Diego Rivera](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/54_d_y_f_conversando_coy_cropped.jpg?h=e229ee9b&itok=9ARD-2ml)\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/fridakahloin45vintagephotos-35.jpg?h=9bbe18b7&itok=OVbql7u7)\n\n1930\u20111931 \n\n### Turbulent times in the United States of America\n\nDiego Rivera received a commission for two wall paintings in California. Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera travelled to the USA.\n\nDuring the first six months of their stay, Kahlo met the surgeon, Dr Leo Eloesser. He diagnosed a prenatal abnormality of the spine as the cause of her medical problems. Kahlo painted a portrait of Eloesser, who would remain her most important medical practitioner\n\nfrom then on. The artist produced six works within this period of six months in the USA.\n\nDuring this time, Frida also cultivated the Mexicaninfluenced clothing style that became characteristic of her, and allowed people to photograph her in this guise.\n\n![1937 - Portrait of Diego Rivera](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1937---Portrait-of-Diego-Rivera---Frida-Kahlo.jpg?h=4aa65539&itok=N-CLByKF)  \n\n1937 - Portrait of Diego Rivera\n\n![1931 - Portrait of Dr. Leo Eloesser](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1931---Portrait-of-Dr.-Leo-Eloesser---Frida-Kahlo.jpg?h=b0214ec0&itok=99hxRIhA)  \n\n1931 - Portrait of Dr. Leo Eloesser\n\n1931\u20111932 \n\n### Medical problems and a miscarriage\n\nIn December 1931, Rivera exhibited his work at the New Yorker Museum of Modern Art. This was only this institution\u2019s second major solo show, following on from an Henri Matisse exhibition.\n\nThe deformation and pain in Kahlo\u2019s right leg became worse and worse.\n\nIn 1932, Frida Kahlo and her husband moved to Detroit. There, Rivera painted a fresco in the Garden Court of the Detroit Institute of Arts.\n\nFrida Kahlo suffered a miscarriage in the third month of a pregnancy.\n\nOn 15th September 1932, her mother died.\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/Frida-Kahlo---Bernard-Silberstein.jpg?h=34e4ec80&itok=JGCik5sW)\n\n![1932 - Henry Ford Hospital](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1932---Henry-Ford-Hospital---Frida-Kahlo.jpg?h=407e9ea8&itok=lxjaP1eG)  \n\n1932 - Henry Ford Hospital\n\n1933 \n\n### Relocation to New York\n\nFrida Kahlo and Diego Rivera moved to New York, where Rivera was to paint a mural entitled \u201cMan at the Crossroads, Looking with Hope and High Vision to the Choosing of a New and Better Future\u201d at the Rockefeller Center.\n\nThis work openly reflected his pessimistic attitude towards capitalism. He failed to obey the instruction to paint over a portrait of Lenin, and the commission was withdrawn from him as a result. The unfinished work was covered over, and was finally destroyed at the beginning of 1934.\n\n![1933 - My Dress Hangs There](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1933---My-Dress-Hangs-There---Frida-Kahlo.jpg?h=8365e7d9&itok=fCx4RQM_)  \n\n1933 - My Dress Hangs There\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/fridakahloin45vintagephotos-13.jpg?h=be8fe776&itok=t62Tnbiq)\n\n1934 \n\n### Return to Mexico and Sister Cristina\n\nThe final return to Mexico. Kahlo and Rivera moved into their new \u201cdouble\u201d house in San \u00c1ngel, a suburb on the outskirts of the capital city. The Museum Estudio Casa Rivera is now housed in this building.\n\nHaving had a first abortion in 1931, Frida now underwent another termination of pregnancy. The painter also lost five toe joints in her first operation on her right foot.\n\nDuring this period, which was already difficult, Frida Kahlo\u2019s husband Diego Rivera embarked upon a relationship with Frida\u2019s younger and best-loved sister, Cristina.\n\nFrida Kahlo did not produce a single picture during this year.\n\n![1932 - Self portrait on the Borderline between Mexico and the United States](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1932---Self-portrait-on-the-Borderline-between-Mexico-and-the-United-States---Frida-Kahlo.jpg?h=cee6f511&itok=JQ5vAbH9)  \n\n1932 - Self portrait on the Borderline between Mexico and the United States\n\n![Frida Kahlo & Diego Rivera](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/9b5e0e381807216c553d7a94528ca736.jpg?h=f194bbb9&itok=oL38k1LV)\n\n1935\u20131936 \n\n### My grandparents, my parents and I\n\nIn 1935, Frida Kahlo left her house in San \u00c1ngel for some months. She met Isamu Noguchi, a sculptor and designer whose roots lay in Japan. Noguchi was a fascinating character and a love affair began between them.\n\nIn 1936, Kahlo painted her work \u201cMy grandparents, my parents and I\u201c.\n\nFrida Kahlo joined Diego Rivera to lobby the Mexican President for asylum to be granted in Mexico to Stalin\u2019s rival, Leon Trotsky.\n\n![1936 - My Grandparents, My Parents, and I](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1936---My-Grandparents%2C-My-Parents%2C-and-I---Frida-Kahlo.jpg?h=74964fd0&itok=fVSpJ9EA)  \n\n1936 - My Grandparents, My Parents, and I\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/fridakahloin45vintagephotos-4.jpg?h=7ce5ba80&itok=0JHD3z8f)\n\n1937\u20131939 \n\n### Leon Trotsky lives as a guest in the Blue House\n\nFrom 1937 to 1939, the Blue House in Coyoac\u00e1n provided shelter for two well-known public figures \u2013 Marxist theoretician Leon Trotsky and his wife Natalia Sedova. They arrived as the result of a personal invitation from Frida Kahlo.\n\nAfter just a few months, Trotsky and Frida Kahlo became lovers. She found it very difficult to deal with Diego Rivera\u2019s affairs, yet still enjoyed quite a few extramarital relationships of her own.\n\nShe also had romantic relationships with a number of women, including Josephine Baker and the Mexican singer Chavela Vargas.\n\n![1937 - Memory, the Heart](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1937---Memory%2C-the-Heart---Frida-Kahlo.jpg?h=5c6d3c2f&itok=QpZ34Djq)  \n\n1937 - Memory, the Heart\n\n![Frida Kahlo & Leon Trotsky](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/Frida-und-Trotsky.jpg?h=b9a2a4b0&itok=dgS0dTtK)\n\n1938 \n\n### \u201cI am not a surrealist\u201d\n\nAndr\u00e9 Breton and his wife, the painter Jacqueline Lamba, visited Mexico in April 1938, and enjoyed lively discussions with Trotsky and Rivera. Breton described Frida Kahlo as a surrealist, which she rejected.\n\nIn the November, Frida Kahlo\u2019s first solo exhibition took place at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York.\n\nKahlo embarked upon a love affair with the Hungarian photographer Nickolas Muray. His photographs of the artist, who was already famous by then, are among the most vivid images of Frida Kahlo.\n\n![1937 - My nurse and I](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1937---My-nurse-and-I---Frida-Kahlo.jpg?h=efe82961&itok=z3qQH1fg)  \n\n1937 - My nurse and I\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/Frida-Kahlo_.jpg?h=a18aa836&itok=Sb0uCYIC)\n\n1939 \n\n### Frida Kahlo\u2019s journey to Paris\n\nAn exhibition initiated by Andr\u00e9 Breton and presented by Marcel Duchamp at the Galerie Renou et Colle in Paris was a great success for Frida Kahlo, who travelled especially there for the opening show.\n\nIn Paris, Kahlo got to know other surrealists and representatives of the Parisian avant-garde, including such famous figures as Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir\u00f3 and Max Ernst.\n\nThe Louvre acquired Frida Kahlo\u2019s painting of \u201cThe Frame\u201d.\n\n![1939 - The Frame](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1938_The-Frame---Frida-Kahlo.jpg?h=5c6d3c2f&itok=Xyro91wK)  \n\n1939 - The Frame\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/fridakahloin45vintagephotos-32.jpg?h=7774754f&itok=5jsWo35S)\n\n1939 \n\n### Return to Mexico and a divorce\n\nHaving returned to Mexico, Frida Kahlo divorced Diego Rivera on 6th November. She could no longer bear his ongoing affairs.\u00a0\n\nOne result of this turbulent period is Kahlo\u2019s painting \u201cSelf-Portrait with Cropped Hair\u201d. The long hair that Rivera loved lies on the floor, and Kahlo wears a man\u2019s suit rather than her traditional Mexican dress.\n\nSevere problems with alcohol and a kidney inflammation forced Frida to stay in hospital for an extended period.\n\n![1940 - Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1940---Self-Portrait-with-Cropped-Hair---Frida-Kahlo.jpg?h=7774754f&itok=SvS_4Mlu)  \n\n1940 - Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/fridakahloin45vintagephotos-23.jpg?h=2caf3739&itok=KTA437tu)\n\n1940\u20131941 \n\n### New paintings and a revived marriage\n\nFrida Kahlo presented two works, \u201cThe Two Fridas\u201d and \u201cThe Wounded Table\u201d, at the International Exhibition of Surrealism at the Galer\u00eda de Arte Mexicano.\n\nOn 8th August in San Francisco, Kahlo and Rivera married each other for the second time. Rivera was painting a picture for the \u201cGolden Gate Exposition\u201d while Kahlo was on an alcohol rehabilitation course. The couple moved into the Blue House in Coyoac\u00e1n in February 1941.\n\nTrotsky was murdered at his home in Coyoac\u00e1n on 21st August 1940, after a first attempted assassination in the May.\n\n![1939 - The Two Fridas](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1939---The-Two-Fridas---Frida-Kahlo_v02.jpg?h=1f815ac5&itok=oAPk0jAF)  \n\n1939 - The Two Fridas\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/b9cb07ce3f18e8df2f1f2a4b57317a49.jpg?h=f42b4a65&itok=AN18Glfl)\n\n1942 \n\n### Diary entries\n\nIn her written and pictorial diary entries, Frida Kahlo not only tried to describe her own physical pain, but also to illustrate the glory of the world.\n\nHer diaries dealt with subjects such as esotericism, sexuality, magic, fertility and illness, just as fully as her personal physical and psychological suffering.\n\n![1953 \u2013 Feet, what do I need them for, If I have wings to fly](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/frida_pies-para-que-los.jpg?h=459f7e2d&itok=A9E7jTVV)  \n\n1953 \u2013 Feet, what do I need them for, If I have wings to fly\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/Photograph-of-Frida-Kahlo-with-The-Love-Embrace-of-the-Universe_-the-Earth-%28Mexico%29-Myself_-Diego_-and-Se%C2%A7or-Xolotl---Florence-Arquin.jpg?h=7392baf0&itok=BSrbBScr)\n\n1943\u20131951 \n\n### A creative time in spite of periods in hospital\n\nIn 1943, Kahlo was made a professor at the \u201cLa Esmeralda\u201d School of Art, where she taught\n\nfor over ten years.\n\nThe National Prize for Painting was awarded to Frida Kahlo in 1946 for her work entitled \u201cMoses\u201d.\n\nIn the following year, she contributed 45 selfportraits to the \u201cExhibition of Mexican Artists from the 18th to the 20th Centuries\u201d.\n\nIn 1948, she re-joined the Communist Party of Mexico.\n\nFrida Kahlo painted the works \u201cDiego and I\u201d and \u201cThe Love Embrace of the Universe\u201d to celebrate the 60th birthday of Diego Rivera.\n\nIn 1950, Kahlo spent nine months in hospital, where she had to endure seven operations in the same area of her spine.\n\nBy now, Frida Kahlo constantly suffered the effects of painkillers, and could only work while lying down. She painted \u201cDr Farill\u201d and \u201cPortrait of my Father\u201d in this period.\n\n![1951 - Self Portrait with the Portrait of Doctor Farill](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1951---Self-Portrait-with-the-Portrait-of-Doctor-Farill---Frida-Kahlo.jpg?h=180c5e67&itok=46YfpvB8)  \n\n1951 - Self Portrait with the Portrait of Doctor Farill\n\n![Frida Kahlo & Dr. Farill](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/poignantlastphotographsfridakahlo-10.jpg?h=931824d7&itok=T7mizgca)\n\n1953 \n\n### First solo exhibition in Mexico, and an amputation\n\nFrida Kahlo\u2019s first solo show in her homeland took place in the Lola \u00c1lvarez Bravo Gallery in Mexico.\n\nBecause of the state of her health, the artist could only attend the opening if she lay in her sick bed.\n\nHer right leg was amputated at the knee later in that same year.\n\nFrida Kahlo attempted suicide during this period.\n\n![1945 - Without Hope](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1945---Without-Hope---Frida-Kahlo.jpg?h=07de8100&itok=CS_XQVxx)  \n\n1945 - Without Hope\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/poignantlastphotographsfridakahlo-13.jpg?h=931824d7&itok=JJ_kE3Of)\n\n1954 \n\n### The final public appearance\n\nFrida Kahlo fell seriously ill in the spring of 1954. She suffered severe pneumonia, which made it necessary for her to go into hospital yet again.\n\nShe remained politically active.\n\nWhile she was still recovering, and against medical advice, Kahlo took part in a demonstration against the North American intervention in Guatemala.\n\nThis was her last appearance in public.\n\n![1954 - Viva la vida](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/1954---Viva-la-vida---Frida-Kahlo.jpg?h=b4a85326&itok=oOpypNrv)  \n\n1954 - Viva la vida\n\n![Frida Kahlo](/sites/default/files/styles/image_4_3__400_300/public/media/images/poignantlastphotographsfridakahlo-9.jpg?h=21d63e24&itok=Xx7A3OAD)\n\n1954 \n\n### **Taking leave of a fascinating artist**\n\nSeven days after her 47th birthday, on 13th July 1954, Frida Kahlo died at the Blue House in Mexico.\n\nThe cause of her death was believed to be a pulmonary embolism. Rumours of suicide from an overdose of painkillers and sleeping pills could not be substantiated.\n\nFrida Kahlo\u2019s body was taken to lie in state at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. She was then cremated, and her urn returned to be set in place in the Blue House.\n\n \n\n[Bild\n\n      ![Logo Alegria Exhibition](/sites/default/files/styles/content_phone_xs_scale/public/media/images/alegria_exhibition.png?itok=SlTtSznc)](https://www.alegria-exhibition.de/)\n\nBitte \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen Sie die markierten Felder\n\nE-Mail\n\nIch stimme der Nutzung meiner Daten zu den in der [Datenschutzerkl\u00e4rung](/algex/unternehmen/datenschutz) angegebenen Zwecken zu.\u00a0Diese Zustimmung kann jederzeit widerrufen werden.\n\nE-Mail Benutzer\n\n[Protected by Spam Master](https://www.spammaster.org)\n\nFooter Service Menu VFK\n-----------------------\n\n* Unternehmen\n  + [Impressum](/impressum)\n  + [Datenschutz](/algex/unternehmen/datenschutz)\n  + [Barrierefreiheit](/vfk/barrierefreiheit)\n* Partner\n  + [Alegria Exhibition](https://www.alegria-exhibition.de/)\n  + [Alegria Konzert](https://www.alegria.de/)\n  + [Monets Garten](https://www.monets-garten.de/)\n  + [M\u00fcnchenMusik](https://www.muenchenmusik.de/)\n  + [M\u00fcnchenEvent](https://www.muenchenevent.de/)\n  + [M\u00fcnchner Konzertdirektion H\u00f6rtnagel](https://muenchen.hoertnagel.de/)\n  + [N\u00fcrnbergMusik](https://www.nuernbergmusik.de/)\n  + [StuttgartKonzert](https://www.stuttgartkonzert.de/)\n  + [Konzertdirektion Hans Adler](https://www.musikadler.de/)\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/vivafridakahlo \"Facebook Viva Frida Kahlo\")\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fridakahloimmersiv_de/ \"Instagram Viva Frida Kahlo\")\n* [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@fridakahloimmersiv \"TikTok Alegria\")"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Tool call call_lJ7MSg8zB9oycHd1pWXoPDpp: calling 'web_search' with arguments: {'query': 'Frida Kahlo first solo exhibition length of exhibit'}\nTool call call_nnvyPzUnTI90Zez8p5wkpswV: calling 'web_search' with arguments: {'query': 'Frida Kahlo first solo exhibition duration 1938'}"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_lJ7MSg8zB9oycHd1pWXoPDpp', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'web_search', 'arguments': {'query': 'Frida Kahlo first solo exhibition length of exhibit'}}}, {'id': 'call_nnvyPzUnTI90Zez8p5wkpswV', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'web_search', 'arguments': {'query': 'Frida Kahlo first solo exhibition duration 1938'}}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\n## Search Results\n0.
