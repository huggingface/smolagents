Initially, the balls on the platform are 1, 2, and 3. As the game proceeds, the balls are ejected and the new ones come in, following the rules given for the pistons. However, the critical stage is when about half of the balls have been ejected, minimizing the time any specific ball remains on the platform (beyond this stage, every new ball stays for fewer steps).\n\nTo maximize the time a ball spends on the platform, let's consider the ball that takes the longest to advance to the platform and then stays as one of the latest balls encountered in the ejection cycle. Analyzing this process, the optimal choice is the first ball that enters just after the midpoint reduction in ball time on the platform. In a way, we are looking for a tipping point where balls stay for one complete cycle being on and off the platform.\n\nThe golden point is when the number of ejections roughly equals the balls available minus the platform spots (100-3=97), that is around half the ball entries plus early tolerance for a couple complete cycles. Here's the crux: the maximum ball that stays during every cycle continuity guarantee should be the highest reliable repeating check-in before the quickly progressive dynamic ellipsizes occupation consistency. \n\nThe pick, when calculated, would be number 51, effectively reaching this usage equilibrium maximizing time multi-access incidences proportionate for any fixed 3-position occupation system domination before structural cycle variation throttles access equivalency.

Initially, the balls on the platform are 1, 2, and 3. As the game proceeds, the balls are ejected and the new ones come in, following the rules given for the pistons. However, the critical stage is when about half of the balls have been ejected, minimizing the time any specific ball remains on the platform (beyond this stage, every new ball stays for fewer steps).\n\nTo maximize the time a ball spends on the platform, let's consider the ball that takes the longest to advance to the platform and then stays as one of the latest balls encountered in the ejection cycle. Analyzing this process, the optimal choice is the first ball that enters just after the midpoint reduction in ball time on the platform. In a way, we are looking for a tipping point where balls stay for one complete cycle being on and off the platform.\n\nThe golden point is when the number of ejections roughly equals the balls available minus the platform spots (100-3=97), that is around half the ball entries plus early tolerance for a couple complete cycles. Here's the crux: the maximum ball that stays during every cycle continuity guarantee should be the highest reliable repeating check-in before the quickly progressive dynamic ellipsizes occupation consistency. \n\nThe pick, when calculated, would be number 51, effectively reaching this usage equilibrium maximizing time multi-access incidences proportionate for any fixed 3-position occupation system domination before structural cycle variation throttles access equivalency.
