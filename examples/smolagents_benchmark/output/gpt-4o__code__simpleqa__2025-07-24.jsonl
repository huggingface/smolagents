DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5.

Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9.

ski\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Alpine_ski_bindings_01.jpg/330px-Alpine_ski_bindings_01.jpg)](/wiki/File:Alpine_ski_bindings_01.jpg)\n\nAlpine step-in ski bindings\n\nA **ski binding** is a device that connects a [ski boot](/wiki/Ski_boot \"Ski boot\") to the [ski](/wiki/Ski \"Ski\"). Before the 1933 invention of [ski lifts](/wiki/Ski_lift \"Ski lift\"), skiers went uphill and down and cross-country on the same gear. As ski lifts became more prevalent, skis\u2014and their bindings\u2014became increasingly specialized, differentiated between [alpine](/wiki/Alpine_skiing \"Alpine skiing\") (downhill) and Nordic ([cross-country](/wiki/Cross-country_skiing \"Cross-country skiing\"), [Telemark](/wiki/Telemark_skiing \"Telemark skiing\"), and [ski jumping](/wiki/Ski_jumping \"Ski jumping\")) styles of skiing. Until the point of divergence in the mid-20th century, bindings held the toe of a flexible, leather boot against the ski and allowed the heel to rise off the ski, typically with a form of strap or cable around the heel.\n\nTo address injuries resulting from falls while skiing downhill on such equipment, ski bindings emerged with the ability to release the toe of the boot sideways, in early models, and to release the boot forward and aft, in later models. Downhill ski bindings became standardized to fit plastic ski boots and incorporated a built-in brake that drags in the snow after the ski detaches from the boot.\n\nCross-country ski bindings evolved from being simple, bent-metal attachment plates with pins, which held a square-toed leather boot toe under a wire bale, to becoming standardized systems that held a plastic boot, attached to a bar in a recess in the boot's toe.\n\nBack-country, jumping, and alpine touring ski bindings incorporate features found in alpine and Nordic bindings.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ski_binding&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")]\n\nPrior to the 1840s, ski bindings were a leather strap fastened over the toe of the boot, similar to those used for snowshoes.[[1]](#cite_note-:2-1)\n\n### Norheim\u2014ca. 1850\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ski_binding&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Norheim\u2014ca. 1850\")]\n\n[Sondre Norheim](/wiki/Sondre_Norheim \"Sondre Norheim\") demonstrated telemark skiing before 1866, and the Open Christiania turn in 1868, both made possible with a binding design which dated back to the late 1840s. This added a loop of twisted birch roots that ran from the existing birch root toe loops around the boot heels and back. This allowed the heel to lift as before, for walking and gliding, but better held the boots to the skis allowing greater control. This enabled Norheim to control the skis with his feet and legs, replacing the former technique of dragging a large pole in the snow on one side or the other to drag the skier in that direction.[[1]](#cite_note-:2-1) This control led to the development of the [telemark](/wiki/Telemark_skiing \"Telemark skiing\") and [stem christie](/wiki/Stem_christie \"Stem christie\") ski turns.[[2]](#cite_note-2)\n\n### Huitfeldt\u20141894\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ski_binding&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Huitfeldt\u20141894\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Huitfeldt-bindingen.JPG/250px-Huitfeldt-bindingen.JPG)](/wiki/File:Huitfeldt-bindingen.JPG)\n\nA late model Huitfeldt-style binding. The toe clip runs through the core of the ski to bend up on either side. This model uses a metal heel strap with a lever buckle instead of an all-leather design.\n\nStarting in 1894, Fritz R. Huitfeldt invented a binding with a secure toe iron which allowed the heel to move freely and evolved through the 1930s as the standard design. His innovations included:[[1]](#cite_note-:2-1)\n\n* Adding vertical metal brackets on either side of the ski to hold the ski boot (1894), augmented in 1897 by passing the iron bracket through a rectangular hole from one side of the ski to the other, before bending up the tabs.\n* Passing toe straps through the rectangular hole and providing a buckle over the top of the boots, attached to the brackets and firmly bind the boot in place.\n* Passing a strap over the free heel, augmented in 1904 with a cam lever substitute for the buckle over the heel, called the \"Hoyer-Ellefsen toggle\".\n\nSkiers wishing to affix their heel to the ski, employed a \"long-thong\" strap.[[1]](#cite_note-:2-1) Further innovations included:[[1]](#cite_note-:2-1)\n\n* [Mathias Zdarsky](/wiki/Mathias_Zdarsky \"Mathias Zdarsky\")'s development of a ski binding that replaced the heel strap with a long metal plate under the sole of the boot, hinged at the front to allow the heel to rise, in the early 1900s. The heel was held to the plate by a short strap attaching at the back.[[3]](#cite_note-3)\n* [Marius Eriksen](/wiki/Marius_Eriksen \"Marius Eriksen\")'s 1920 introduction of pre-formed plates that were screwed on top of the ski.\n* Guido Ruege's 1929 invention of the Kandahar binding, which incorporated a front-throw lever that tightened the heel cable past the ski-mounted toe brackets and became known as the [cable binding](/wiki/Cable_binding \"Cable binding\").[[4]](#cite_note-:3-4)\n\n### Rottefella\u20141927\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ski_binding&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Rottefella\u20141927\")]\n\nThe [Rottefella](/wiki/Rottefella \"Rottefella\") binding was developed in 1927 by [Bror With](/wiki/Bror_With \"Bror With\"). \"Rottefella\" means \"rat trap\" in [Norwegian](/wiki/Norwegian_language \"Norwegian language\").[[5]](#cite_note-5) A bent, pressed-metal plate had three or four pins that stuck into the toe of a square-toed boot, which was clamped down with a metal bail. After victories at the [1928 Winter Olympics](/wiki/1928_Winter_Olympics \"1928 Winter Olympics\") in [St. Moritz](/wiki/St._Moritz \"St. Moritz\"), the binding remained the standard type for [cross-country skiing](/wiki/Cross-country_skiing_(sport) \"Cross-country skiing (sport)\") through much of the century and continues as the [Nordic Norm](#Nordic_Norm_(NN)), manufactured by Rottefella and other companies.[[6]](#cite_note-:0-6)\n\n### Cable\u20141929\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ski_binding&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Cable\u20141929\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Trulte-Heide-Steen-OB.RD0001e.jpg/250px-Trulte-Heide-Steen-OB.RD0001e.jpg)](/wiki/File:Trulte-Heide-Steen-OB.RD0001e.jpg)\n\nCable binding\n\nMain article: [Cable binding](/wiki/Cable_binding \"Cable binding\")\n\nThe introduction of the cable binding allowed the [Christie turn](/wiki/Stem_Christie \"Stem Christie\") to become a standard on downhill runs, and to further support this style of skiing the Swiss racer Guido Reuge in 1929 invented a cable binding with steel clips below the boot heel to enable clamping the heel down for downhill portions. He named the product \"Kandahar\" for the international [Kandahar Cup ski races](/wiki/Arlberg-Kandahar \"Arlberg-Kandahar\").[[4]](#cite_note-:3-4) In use in alpine races, the Kandahar binding led to serious leg injuries, and by 1939 experimentation began in earnest on bindings that would release the boot in a fall.[[7]](#cite_note-:6-7)\n\n### Saf-Ski\u20141937\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ski_binding&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Saf-Ski\u20141937\")]\n\n[Hjalmar Hvam](/wiki/Hjalmar_Hvam \"Hjalmar Hvam\") broke his leg skiing, and while recuperating from surgery, invented the Saf-Ski toe binding in 1937, which he later sold under the slogan \"Hvoom with Hvam\".[[8]](#cite_note-8) This was a metal clip with a pyramidal top that fit into a slot cut into the sole of the ski boot. When the boot was rotated forward, the slot on the toe eventually rose above the metal pyramid, allowing the toe to release from the ski. The system was considered with suspicion by professional skiers, especially when Olaf Rodegaard released during a race. However, Rodegaard credited the release with saving him from a broken leg.[[7]](#cite_note-:6-7) In the post-war era, Hvam sold several thousand pairs of Saf-Skis, in an era when alpine skiing was in its infancy. Hvam continued to sell the Saf-Ski into the 1960s, but in 1966 his insurance rates increased so dramatically that he was forced from the market.[[7]](#cite_note-:6-7)\n\n### Look Nevada\u20141950\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ski_binding&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Look Nevada\u20141950\")]\n\nThe introduction of the [Look Nevada](/wiki/Look_Nevada \"Look Nevada\") in 1950 represented a significant advance in ski bindings. The Nevada held the toe centred over the ski using two metal fingers shaped into an upside-down V. The fingers were pivoted to allow motion to the sides, and centred with a spring. During a fall, sideways torsion could overcome the force of the spring and allow the boot to release directly to the side. This design was quickly copied by other vendors, notably [Marker](/wiki/Marker_(ski_bindings) \"Marker (ski bindings)\"), and had the first real impact on the dominance of the fixed-toe bindings. By the late 1950s, there were about 35 different release toe bindings on the US market,[[7]](#cite_note-:6-7) most of which used a normal Kandahar-style heel cable.\n\n### Cubco\u20141950\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ski_binding&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Cubco\u20141950\")]\n\nThe first modern heel-and-toe binding for alpine skiing was the Cubco binding, first introduced in 1950 but not popular until about 1960. A heel-release binding faced the problem that there was no obvious place to attach to on the heel, so the Cubco solved this by screwing small metal clips into the sole of the boot. This also eliminated the changes in performance as the sole of the boot wore down, or the geometry of the sole changed as the boot wore into the skier's foot.[[7]](#cite_note-:6-7)\n\n### Heel-release\u20141960s\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ski_binding&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Heel-release\u20141960s\")]\n\nMarker introduced the Rotomat, which gripped onto the sole where it extended past the heel, and Look quickly followed suit with their Grand Prix design. By the mid-1960s, release bindings that worked on both the heel and the toe were common, and by the late 1960s, the cable binding had disappeared from alpine skiing.[[7]](#cite_note-:6-7)[[9]](#cite_note-:5-9)\n\n### Plate systems\u20141970s\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ski_binding&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Plate systems\u20141970s\")]\n\nOne problem with 1960s release bindings was that the boots were not standardized, and a binding that worked well on one boot might be dangerous on another, or might become dangerous over time as the boot shifted about. This led to the introduction of plate bindings, which used a metal plate firmly clipped to the sole of the boot, and bindings that clamped onto the plate. The plate could be easily removed for walking about. Plate bindings were popular in the US in the 1970s, notably the [BURT Retractable Bindings](/wiki/BURT_Retractable_Bindings \"BURT Retractable Bindings\") and [Spademan binding](/wiki/Spademan_binding \"Spademan binding\"), but never caught on in any major way in Europe. As more and more of the alpine skiing market came under control of European companies, the plate bindings disappeared, in spite of their excellent safety records.[[10]](#cite_note-10)\n\n### Standardized plastic boot-compatible systems\u20141970s\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ski_binding&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: Standardized plastic boot-compatible systems\u20141970s\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Salomon_bindings_1980s_2011.jpg/250px-Salomon_bindings_1980s_2011.jpg)](/wiki/File:Salomon_bindings_1980s_2011.jpg)\n\nAlpine ski bindings, featuring integrated ski brakes and step-in-step-out heels (ca. 1980s, behind, 2010s, in front).\n\nThe disappearance of the plate and alternate systems was due to a combination of factors, notably the introduction of standardized hard plastic boots. Plastic was first introduced by [Lange](/wiki/Lange_(ski_boots) \"Lange (ski boots)\") as a way of improving existi\n..._This content has been truncated to stay below 40000 characters_...\nIS skis allow installation of non-NIS bindings.[[24]](#cite_note-rei-24)\n\n#### Turnamic (IFP)\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ski_binding&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit section: Turnamic (IFP)\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Turnamic_XC_ski_binding.jpg/250px-Turnamic_XC_ski_binding.jpg)](/wiki/File:Turnamic_XC_ski_binding.jpg)\n\nTurnamic binding. Boot locking lever is in the \"open\" position. IFP latch is in the center (with \"IFP\" stamped on it), the position offset indicators show zeroes.\n\nIn 2016, Fischer and Rossignol introduced a new \"integrated fixation plate\" (IFP) binding, which allows tool-less adjustment of the NNN-compatible binding position. The Turnamic binding uses step-in locking for the boot, and the lock closes or opens by turning the lever to the side.[[27]](#cite_note-27)\n\n#### Prolink\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ski_binding&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit section: Prolink\")]\n\nWith the decline in sales of its SNS systems, Salomon introduced its NNN-compatible Prolink system in 2016.[[28]](#cite_note-28)\n\n### New Telemark Norm (NTN)\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ski_binding&action=edit&section=22 \"Edit section: New Telemark Norm (NTN)\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/NTN_Telemark_Bindings.jpg/250px-NTN_Telemark_Bindings.jpg)](/wiki/File:NTN_Telemark_Bindings.jpg)\n\nNew Telemark Norm (NTN) Binding\n\nIn 2007, Rottefella introduced the New Telemark Norm binding featuring lateral release, adjustability, and a freely pivoting toe attachment.[[29]](#cite_note-29)[[30]](#cite_note-30)\n\n### Ski jumping\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ski_binding&action=edit&section=23 \"Edit section: Ski jumping\")]\n\nSki jumping bindings attach to the toe of square-toed plastic boots that extend above the ankles; they allow for the boot heel to rise off the skis. They are designed to release the boot, in case of a fall.[[31]](#cite_note-31)\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ski_binding&action=edit&section=24 \"Edit section: References\")]\n\n1. ^ [***a***](#cite_ref-:2_1-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-:2_1-1) [***c***](#cite_ref-:2_1-2) [***d***](#cite_ref-:2_1-3) [***e***](#cite_ref-:2_1-4) Lert, Wolfgang (March 2002).

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

From 1986 he was a professor of Materials Science, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering,[[3]](#cite_note-3) at the [University of Texas at Austin](/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin \"University of Texas at Austin\"). He is credited with\nidentifying the [Goodenough\u2013Kanamori rules](/wiki/Goodenough%E2%80%93Kanamori_rules \"Goodenough\u2013Kanamori rules\") of the sign of the magnetic [superexchange](/wiki/Superexchange \"Superexchange\") in materials, with developing materials for computer [random-access memory](/wiki/Random-access_memory \"Random-access memory\") and with inventing cathode materials for [lithium-ion batteries](/wiki/Lithium-ion_batteries \"Lithium-ion batteries\").\n\nGoodenough was awarded the [National Medal of Science](/wiki/National_Medal_of_Science \"National Medal of Science\"), the [Copley Medal](/wiki/Copley_Medal \"Copley Medal\"), the [Fermi Award](/wiki/Enrico_Fermi_Award \"Enrico Fermi Award\"), the [Draper Prize](/wiki/Charles_Stark_Draper_Prize \"Charles Stark Draper Prize\"), and the [Japan Prize](/wiki/Japan_Prize \"Japan Prize\"). The [John B. Goodenough Award](/wiki/John_B._Goodenough_Award \"John B. Goodenough Award\") in materials science is named for him.

His father, a graduate student at [Oxford](/wiki/University_of_Oxford \"University of Oxford\") when John was born, eventually became a professor of religious history at [Yale](/wiki/Yale_University \"Yale University\").[[7]](#cite_note-:3-7)[[8]](#cite_note-8) His brother [Ward](/wiki/Ward_Goodenough \"Ward Goodenough\") became an anthropology professor at the [University of Pennsylvania](/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania \"University of Pennsylvania\").[[9]](#cite_note-9) John also had two half-siblings from his father's second marriage: [Ursula Goodenough](/wiki/Ursula_Goodenough \"Ursula Goodenough\"), emeritus professor of [biology](/wiki/Biology \"Biology\") at [Washington University in St. Louis](/wiki/Washington_University_in_St._Louis \"Washington University in St. Louis\"); and Daniel Goodenough, emeritus professor of [biology](/wiki/Biology \"Biology\") at [Harvard Medical School](/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School \"Harvard Medical School\").[[10]](#cite_note-:0-10)\n\nIn his school years Goodenough suffered from [dyslexia](/wiki/Dyslexia \"Dyslexia\"). At the time, dyslexia was poorly understood by the medical community, and Goodenough's condition went undiagnosed and untreated.[[10]](#cite_note-:0-10) Although his primary schools considered him \"a backward student,\" he taught himself to write so that he could take the entrance exam for [Groton School](/wiki/Groton_School \"Groton School\"), the boarding school where his older brother was studying at the time.[[10]](#cite_note-:0-10)[[11]](#cite_note-:1-11) He was awarded a full scholarship.[[7]](#cite_note-:3-7) At Groton, his grades improved and he eventually graduated at the top of his class in 1940.[[10]](#cite_note-:0-10)[[12]](#cite_note-12) He also developed an interest in exploring nature, plants, and animals.[[13]](#cite_note-13) Although he was raised an atheist, he converted to [Protestant Christianity](/wiki/Protestantism \"Protestantism\") in high school.[[11]](#cite_note-:1-11)[[14]](#cite_note-14)[[15]](#cite_note-15)\n\nAfter Groton, Goodenough gradua\n..._This content has been truncated to stay below 40000 characters_...\neth Sanborn Pitzer](/wiki/Kenneth_Sanborn_Pitzer \"Kenneth Sanborn Pitzer\")  1975  [Hans A.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician.

In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nIn which year did Atul Gawande earn an M.A. in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) from Balliol College, Oxford?

DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Answer with only the final number.", "original_question": "In what year did Sir William Beechey (British Portraitist) retire to Hampstead?", "answer": "1836", "true_answer": "1836", "source": "SimpleQA", "intermediate_steps": [{"role": "system", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

[Burford](/wiki/Burford \"Burford\"), Oxfordshire, on 12 December 1753, the son of William Beechey, a solicitor, and his wife Hannah Read. Both parents died when he was still quite young in the early 1760s, and he and his siblings were brought up by his uncle Samuel, a solicitor who lived in nearby [Chipping Norton](/wiki/Chipping_Norton \"Chipping Norton\").[[2]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoberts19073-2)\n\nThe uncle was determined that the young Beechey should likewise follow a career in the law, and at an appropriate age he was entered as a clerk with a conveyancer near [Stow-on-the-Wold](/wiki/Stow-on-the-Wold \"Stow-on-the-Wold\"). But as *[The Monthly Mirror](/wiki/The_Monthly_Mirror \"The Monthly Mirror\")* later recorded in July 1798, he was: \"Early foredoomed his [uncle's] soul to cross/ And paint a picture where he should engross\".[[3]](#cite_note-Historical_Portraits_-_Philip_Mould-3)\n\nCareer\n------\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=William_Beechey&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Career\")]\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | This section **needs additional citations for [verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

He first exhibited at the Academy in 1776. His earliest surviving portraits are small-scale full-length and conversation pieces which are reminiscent of Zoffany. In 1782, he moved to Norwich, where he gained several commissions, including a portrait of [John Wodehouse](/wiki/John_Wodehouse,_1st_Baron_Wodehouse \"John Wodehouse, 1st Baron Wodehouse\") and a series of civic portraits for [St. Andrew's Hall, Norwich](/wiki/St_Andrew%27s_and_Blackfriars%27_Hall,_Norwich \"St Andrew's and Blackfriars' Hall, Norwich\"). By 1787, he had returned to London, and in 1789, he exhibited a celebrated portrait of [John Douglas, Bishop of Carlisle](/wiki/John_Douglas_(bishop_of_Salisbury) \"John Douglas (bishop of Salisbury)\") (now in [Lambeth Palace](/wiki/Lambeth_Palace \"Lambeth Palace\")). Beechey's career during this period is marked by a succession of adept and restrained portraits in the tradition of [Joshua Reynolds](/wiki/Joshua_Reynolds \"Joshua Reynolds\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/George_III.jpg/250px-George_III.jpg)](/wiki/File:George_III.jpg)\n\n*King George III*, by William Beechey, 1799\u20131800\n\nBeechey's style perfectly suited the conventional taste of the royal family, and in 1793, he was commissioned to paint a full-length portrait of [Queen Charlotte](/wiki/Charlotte_of_Mecklenburg-Strelitz \"Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\") and subsequently named as her official portrait painter. That same year, he was elected as an associate member of the Royal Academy.[[4]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911-4)\n\nFollowing his royal appointment, the number of royal commissions he undertook increased markedly, and in 1797 he exhibited six royal portraits. In 1798, he was elected a full member of the Royal Academy[[5]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTERedgraveRedgrave1947131-5) and painted *[George III and the Prince of Wales Reviewing Troops](/wiki/George_III_and_the_Prince_of_Wales_Reviewing_Troops \"George III and the Prince of Wales Reviewing Troops\")* for that year's academy's exhibition. This enormous composition depicts King [George III](/wiki/George_III \"George III\"), the [Prince of Wales](/wiki/George_IV \"George IV\") and staff officers on horseback at an imagined cavalry review in [Hyde Park](/wiki/Hyde_Park,_London \"Hyde Park, London\"). The King was reported to be delighted with the painting and rewarded Beechey with a knighthood.[[4]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911-4)\n\n[Joseph Farington](/wiki/Joseph_Farington \"Joseph Farington\")'s Diaries give many accounts of Beechey's relations with the royal family during this period, including his temporary fall from favour in 1804, which Farington attributes to the vagaries of George III's mental condition.\n\nBeechey's portraits of the turn of the century are considered to be his most colourful and lively. They are closer to the flamboyant and free techniques employed by his younger rivals, [John Hoppner](/wiki/John_Hoppner \"John Hoppner\") and Sir [Thomas Lawrence](/wiki/Thomas_Lawrence \"Thomas Lawrence\").\n\nRoyal patronage resumed in around 1813, when Beechey was appointed portrait painter to [Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh](/wiki/Prince_William_Frederick,_Duke_of_Gloucester_and_Edinburgh \"Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh\"), and culminated with his appointment in 1830 as principal portrait painter to [William IV](/wiki/William_IV \"William IV\"). In 1830, he stood for election as [President of the Royal Academy](/wiki/List_of_officers_of_the_Royal_Academy_of_Arts \"List of officers of the Royal Academy of Arts\") following the death of Thomas Lawrence, finishing second to [Martin Archer Shee](/wiki/Martin_Archer_Shee \"Martin Archer Shee\").[[6]](#cite_note-6) In 1836, Beechey retired to [Hampstead](/wiki/Hampstead \"Hampstead\") and on 9\u201311 June that year, the contents of his studio along with his collection were sold at [Christie's](/wiki/Christie%27s \"Christie's\").\n\nAlthough capable of impetuousness and irascibility, Beechey was known for his generosity to students. In particular, he took a close interest in the career of the young [John Constable](/wiki/John_Constable \"John Constable\").\n\nSubjects\n--------\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=William_Beechey&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Subjects\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Sir_William_Beechey_%281753-1839%29_-_Victoria%2C_Duchess_of_Kent%2C_%281786-1861%29_with_Princess_Victoria%2C_%281819-1901%29_-_RCIN_407169_-_Royal_Collection.jpg/250px-Sir_William_Beechey_%281753-1839%29_-_Victoria%2C_Duchess_of_Kent%2C_%281786-1861%29_with_Princess_Victoria%2C_%281819-1901%29_-_RCIN_407169_-_Royal_Collection.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sir_William_Beechey_(1753-1839)_-_Victoria,_Duchess_of_Kent,_(1786-1861)_with_Princess_Victoria,_(1819-1901)_-_RCIN_407169_-_Royal_Collection.jpg)\n\nBeechey's *[Victoria, Duchess of Kent with Princess Victoria](/wiki/Victoria,_Duchess_of_Kent_with_Princess_Victoria \"Victoria, Duchess of Kent with Princess Victoria\")* at [Kensington Palace](/wiki/Kensington_Palace \"Kensington Palace\"), 1821\n\nDuring a prolific career spanning half a century, Beechey painted many of the leading figures of his day.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

It is built on the main coastal road 3.5 miles (5.6\u00a0km) southeast of [Alnwick](/wiki/Alnwick \"Alnwick\"), on the north bank of the [River Aln](/wiki/River_Aln \"River Aln\"). [Alnmouth railway station](/wiki/Alnmouth_railway_station \"Alnmouth railway station\") is about half a mile away.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lesbury&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")]\n\nThe village has a long history. The [Anglican Church](/wiki/Anglicanism \"Anglicanism\") of St Mary was mentioned in records dating back to 1147, and records from the end of the 13th century state that there were thirteen residents eligible to pay tax. [Robert de Emeldon](/wiki/Robert_de_Emeldon \"Robert de Emeldon\"), later [Lord Treasurer of Ireland](/wiki/Lord_Treasurer_of_Ireland \"Lord Treasurer of Ireland\"), was parish priest of Lesbury in the 1320s.\n\nIn the 18th century, a schoolroom and master's house were built, paid for by [Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland](/wiki/Algernon_Percy,_4th_Duke_of_Northumberland \"Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland\"). By 1897, the village had a large corn mill, as well as a reading room with 500 volumes in the library.\n\nThe name 'Lesbury' is derived from Laece Burg (the town of the leech or physician).[[2]](#cite_note-2)\n\nThe church, originally Norman, was restored by [Anthony Salvin](/wiki/Anthony_Salvin \"Anthony Salvin\") in 1846. It has a square 13th-century tower with a pyramidal roof and a lofty arch on round columns. The 13th-century chancel has a 15th-century roof with oak beams decorated at intervals with little carvings of foliage. The heavy eight-sided font, boldly carved with the Percy locket and crescent, is of about the same age.\n\nIn the south wall of the nave are three lancet windows in memory of Sir Henry Hall Scott, founder of the Imperial Yeomanry of South Africa, and his son, Captain George Hall Scott, who fell at the Battle of the Somme. They are the work of the A.K. Nicholson studios. The central lights show [Joan of Arc](/wiki/Joan_of_Arc \"Joan of Arc\") and [St George](/wiki/St_George \"St George\") standing above graphic representations of the siege of Orleans and the capture of the village of Montauban by the British and French in 1916.\n\nThe glass in the west window is in memory of George Bray, vicar from 1908 to 1934. An earlier vicar was [Percival Stockdale](/wiki/Percival_Stockdale \"Percival Stockdale\"), a writer of some reputation, who died here in 1811 and was buried at [Cornhill on Tweed](/wiki/Cornhill_on_Tweed \"Cornhill on Tweed\"). Lesbury's most notable parson was Patrick Mackilwyan, who has a place in [Thomas Fuller](/wiki/Thomas_Fuller \"Thomas Fuller\")'s *Worthies of England*. He started off by insisting on having his tithes in kind, but settled down with his parishioners and won their regard by visiting the sick in their tents on the moor during the [Plague of 1665](/wiki/Plague_of_1665 \"Plague of 1665\"), although he was then 97. He died there at 101, declaring that \"Of friends and books, good and few are best.\"\n\nGovernance\n----------\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lesbury&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Governance\")]\n\nAn [electoral ward](/wiki/Wards_and_electoral_divisions_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom\") in the same name exists.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nIn which year did Melbourne's Monash Gallery of Art (MGA) rebrand and become the Museum of Australian Photography (MAPh)?

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5.

Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.

DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.

Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results.

He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

\"Help:IPA/English\") [\u24d8](/wiki/File:En-us-Houston.ogg \"File:En-us-Houston.ogg\") [*HEW-st\u0259n*](/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key \"Help:Pronunciation respelling key\"); born 17 February 1954) is a New Zealand-Australian former pastor and evangelist. He was the founder and senior pastor at [Hillsong Church](/wiki/Hillsong_Church \"Hillsong Church\"), based in [Sydney](/wiki/Sydney \"Sydney\") with locations around the world. He was the national president of [Australian Christian Churches](/wiki/Australian_Christian_Churches \"Australian Christian Churches\"), the Australian branch of the [Assemblies of God](/wiki/Assemblies_of_God \"Assemblies of God\"), from 1997 to 2009.\n\nIn January 2022, Houston stepped aside from his roles within the church, after being criminally charged in Australia for allegedly concealing sexual abuse of a child by his father, of which he became aware in the 1990s. In March 2022, he stepped down as the global senior pastor of the church, after he was found to have breached the moral code of the church in his behaviour towards two women.[[1]](#cite_note-1) In August 2023, he was found not guilty of concealing a serious indictable offence.[[2]](#cite_note-2)\n\nLife and career\n---------------\n\n### Early life\n\nBrian Charles Houston was born in Auckland, New Zealand, on 17 February 1954.[[3]](#cite_note-statement-3)[[4]](#cite_note-4) His parents, [Frank](/wiki/Frank_Houston \"Frank Houston\") and Hazel, were then [Salvation Army](/wiki/Salvation_Army \"Salvation Army\") officers. When Houston was three his parents joined the [Assemblies of God in New Zealand](/wiki/Assemblies_of_God_in_New_Zealand \"Assemblies of God in New Zealand\") and began pastoring a church in [Lower Hutt](/wiki/Lower_Hutt \"Lower Hutt\"), near [Wellington](/wiki/Wellington,_New_Zealand \"Wellington, New Zealand\"),[[5]](#cite_note-hey-5):\u200a62 where Houston and his brother and three sisters spent their childhood. After completing school he went to a Bible college for three years.[[5]](#cite_note-hey-5):\u200a66 Shortly after completing college he met his future wife, [Bobbie](/wiki/Bobbie_Houston \"Bobbie Houston\"), on [Papamoa Beach](/wiki/Papamoa_Beach \"Papamoa Beach\") in New Zealand during a Christian convention. They were married in 1977.\n\n### Ministry\n\nAfter moving to Sydney, [New South Wales](/wiki/New_South_Wales \"New South Wales\"), Australia, in 1978, Houston served at the [Sydney Christian Life Centre](/wiki/Sydney_Christian_Life_Centre \"Sydney Christian Life Centre\") in [Darlinghurst](/wiki/Darlinghurst \"Darlinghurst\"), where he became the assistant pastor to his father, Frank.[[6]](#cite_note-6) In 1980 he started a church on the [Central Coast](/wiki/Central_Coast_(New_South_Wales) \"Central Coast (New South Wales)\") and worked at a church in [Liverpool](/wiki/Liverpool,_New_South_Wales \"Liverpool, New South Wales\") in 1981. In 1983, Houston hired the Baulkham Hills Public School hall in Sydney's north-western suburbs to start a new church, the Hills Christian Life Centre.[[7]](#cite_note-7)[[8]](#cite_note-8) The first service was held on Sunday, 14 August 1983.\n\nIn May 1997, Houston was elected the president of the Assemblies of God in Australia (now called Australian Christian Churches) after the retirement of [Andrew Evans](/wiki/Andrew_Evans_(pastor) \"Andrew Evans (pastor)\"). In February 2000, Houston helped to create the Australian Christian Churches network of Pentecostal churches. This alliance represented about 200,000 regular attenders in affiliate churches[[9]](#cite_note-Croucher-9) and Houston was its inaugural president.[[10]](#cite_note-User_2000-10) He is also a member of the Australian Pentecostal Ministers Fellowship (APMF).[[11]](#cite_note-11)\n\nHouston founded [Hillsong Music Australia](/wiki/Hillsong_Music_Australia \"Hillsong Music Australia\") (HMA), the music ministry of Hillsong Church.[[12]](#cite_note-Credits-12) Over a number of years, this music ministry has been successful with chart-topping albums from [Hillsong United](/wiki/Hillsong_United \"Hillsong United\") (born out of the youth ministry), and [Hillsong Worship](/wiki/Hillsong_Worship \"Hillsong Worship\"), which is the \"worship expression\" of Hillsong Church and incorporates their entire worship team.[*[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify \"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")*] Annually, Hillsong records a live album, and songs from this recording are sung by church congregations all over the world. Hillsong songs include \"[Mighty to Save](/wiki/Mighty_to_Save_(song) \"Mighty to Save (song)\")\" and \"[Shout to the Lord](/wiki/Shout_to_the_Lord \"Shout to the Lord\")\"; with the latter featured on a 2008 special episode of *[American Idol](/wiki/American_Idol \"American Idol\")* called \"Idol Gives Back\".[[13]](#cite_note-Shout_to_the_Lord_on_American_Idol-13)\n\nIn September 2018, Hillsong left the Australian Christian Churches to become an autonomous denomination, identifying itself more as a global and [charismatic](/wiki/Evangelical_charismatic_movement \"Evangelical charismatic movement\") church.[[14]](#cite_note-14) According to both Hillsong and ACC, the parting was amicable.[[15]](#cite_note-split-15)\n\nOn 5 August 2021, [New South Wales Police](/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police \"New South Wales Police\") issued a warrant for Houston's arrest, alleging that he concealed [child sexual abuse by his father, Frank](/wiki/Frank_Houston#Sexual_crimes_against_children \"Frank Houston\"). Houston was in the United States at the time of being charged and resigned from the church's board as a result of his arrest.[[16]](#cite_note-charged-16)\n\nIn March 2022, Houston resigned his position as senior global pastor after an internal investigation into his conduct with two women connected to the church. It was reported that in 2013 and 2019 he had engaged in inappropriate behaviour with both women.[[17]](#cite_note-knowlesnguyen2022-17)[[18]](#cite_note-alexander2022-18)[[19]](#cite_note-knowles2022-19)\n\nIn December 2023, Houston announced plans for starting a new community and church in 2024. [[20]](#cite_note-20)\n\n### Views on homosexuality\n\nHouston has made public comments on homosexuality[[21]](#cite_note-21)[[22]](#cite_note-22)[[23]](#cite_note-23)[[24]](#cite_note-24)[[25]](#cite_note-25) and [same-sex marriage](/wiki/Same-sex_marriage \"Same-sex marriage\"):[[26]](#cite_note-26)\n\n> \"I do believe God's word is clear that marriage is between a man and a woman ... Hillsong Church welcomes ALL people but does not affirm all lifestyles. Put clearly, we do not affirm a gay lifestyle and because of this we do not knowingly have actively gay people in positions of leadership, either paid or unpaid.\"\n>\n> \u2014\u200a*Do I Love Gay People?*, Brian Houston, August 2015.\n\nHouston has said, \"I think my father was homosexual, a closet homosexual.\"[[27]](#cite_note-27)\n\nSexual abuse by Frank Houston\n-----------------------------\n\nOn 10 May 1999, Houston's father, [Frank Houston](/wiki/Frank_Houston \"Frank Houston\"), stepped down from the role of senior pastor at Sydney Christian Life Centre and Houston was appointed to the position.[[3]](#cite_note-statement-3) Brian Houston said that Frank \"appeared rushed\" to hand his church to him. This was before the revelations of Frank's [child sexual abuse](/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse \"Child sexual abuse\") became known.[[28]](#cite_note-28) Fifteen years later, in 2014, Houston spoke at hearings held by the [Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse](/wiki/Royal_Commission_into_Institutional_Responses_to_Child_Sexual_Abuse \"Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse\"), stating that he received an allegation in October 1999 that his father sexually abused an Australian boy. Houston's statement and the evidence submitted to the commission revealed that, in November 1999, his father confessed to child sexual abuse.[[3]](#cite_note-statement-3) Houston reportedly forced his father into retirement and did not go to the police.[[29]](#cite_note-thecut-29)[[30]](#cite_note-npr-30) The royal commission censured Houston for his failure to report the sexual abuse allegations against his father and for his failure to avoid a clear [conflict of interest](/wiki/Conflict_of_interest \"Conflict of interest\") investigating his own father while serving as national president of the Assemblies of God in Australia.[[31]](#cite_note-censure-31)[[32]](#cite_note-32)[[33]](#cite_note-33)[[30]](#cite_note-npr-30)\n\nOn 5 August 2021, NSW Police issued a warrant for Houston to attend the Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney on 5 October, alleging that he concealed child sexual abuse by his father. Houston was in the United States at the time of being charged and resigned from the church's board as a result of his arrest.[[16]](#cite_note-charged-16) He was charged with concealing a serious indictable offence.[[34]](#cite_note-:0-34) Houston stood trial at Downing Centre Local Court and pleaded not guilty.[[34]](#cite_note-:0-34)[[35]](#cite_note-35) In August 2023, he was found not guilty. The magistrate determined Houston had a \"reasonable excuse\" for not reporting his father as Houston believed the victim did not want the allegations reported to the police,[[36]](#cite_note-36) however, the victim testified at trial that he did not make this request.[[37]](#cite_note-37)\n\nFamily and personal life\n------------------------\n\nHouston and his wife Bobbie reside in the suburb of [Glenhaven](/wiki/Glenhaven,_New_South_Wales \"Glenhaven, New South Wales\"), Sydney, Australia. They have three children, [Joel](/wiki/Joel_Houston \"Joel Houston\"), Ben, and Laura. All are married and involved in the leadership of Hillsong Church.[[38]](#cite_note-Joel-38)[[39]](#cite_note-Ben-39)[[40]](#cite_note-Laura-40)\n\nHouston has been friends with Australian prime minister [Scott Morrison](/wiki/Scott_Morrison \"Scott Morrison\"), who described Houston as a mentor during his maiden address to parliament in 2008.[[41]](#cite_note-41) Morrison has, however, distanced himself from Houston following the circumstances of Houston's resignation from Hillsong Church.[[42]](#cite_note-42)\n\nWritings\n--------\n\nDetails of books written by Houston:\n\n| Title | Year | ISBN | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Get a Life* | 1996 | [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) \"ISBN (identifier)\")\u00a0[978-0957733619](/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0957733619 \"Special:BookSources/978-0957733619\") | No longer in print |\n| *You Can Change the Future* | 1999 | [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) \"ISBN (identifier)\")\u00a0[978-0957733626](/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0957733626 \"Special:BookSources/978-0957733626\") | No longer in print |\n| *You Need More Money* | 1999 | [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) \"ISBN (identifier)\")\u00a0[978-0957733602](/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0957733602 \"Special:BookSources/978-0957733602\") | No longer in print |\n| *How to Build Great Relationships* | 2002 | [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) \"ISBN (identifier)\")\u00a0[978-0957733671](/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0957733671 \"Special:BookSources/978-0957733671\") |  |\n| *How to Live a Blessed Life* | 2002 | [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) \"ISBN (identifier)\")\u00a0[978-0957733633](/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0957733633 \"Special:BookSources/978-0957733633\") |  |\n| *How to Flourish in Life* | 2003 | [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) \"ISBN (identifier)\")\u00a0[978-0957733688](/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0957733688 \"Special:BookSources/978-0957733688\") |  |\n| *How to Make Wise Decisions* | 2004 | [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) \"ISBN (identifier)\")\u00a0[978-0957733602](/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0957733602 \"Special:BookSources/978-0957733602\") |  |\n| *How to Live in Health & Wholeness* | 2005 | [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) \"ISBN (identifier)\")\u00a0[978-0975206003](/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0975206003 \"Special:BookSources/978-0975206003\") |  |\n| *Selah* | 2006 | [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) \"ISBN (identifier)\")\u00a0[978-0975206027](/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0975206027 \"Special:BookSources/978-0975206027\") |  |\n| *For This Cause* | 2006 | [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) \"ISBN (identifier)\")\u00a0[978-0957733657](/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0957733657 \"Special:BookSources/978-0957733657\") |  |\n| *Selah 2* | 2007 | [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) \"ISBN (identifier)\")\u00a0[978-0975206034](/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0975206034 \"Special:BookSources/978-0975206034\") |  |\n| *For This I Was Born* | 2008 | [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) \"ISBN (identifier)\")\u00a0[978-0849919138](/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0849919138 \"Special:BookSources/978-0849919138\") |  |\n| *Live Love Lead* | 2015 | [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) \"ISBN (identifier)\")\u00a0[978-1455533428](/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-1455533428 \"Special:BookSources/978-1455533428\") |  |\n| *There Is More* | 2018 | [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) \"ISBN (identifier)\")\u00a0[978-0735290617](/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0735290617 \"Special:BookSources/978-0735290617\") |  |\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-1)** Alexander, Harriet (23 March 2022).

DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5.

Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.

Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8.

The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nWhat is the durability of the Istarelle spear from Demon's Souls (2009)?

Spears are capable of inflicting narrow attacks, dealing heavy damage from mid-range. They work best against enemies wearing armor made of metal and hard scales but can easily be parried by enemies and struggle at breaking an enemy's guard. Players can equip the\u00a0**Spear**\u00a0along with a\u00a0[Shield](/shields \"Demons Souls shields\")\u00a0to have a balance between defense and attack.\n\n> A short spear of hard oak. It is covered with engravings and is one of the few Revelations from God.Once belonged to the Holy Knight Lizaia. Its holiness increases the wielder's resistance to plague and poison.\n\n### Istarelle Location:\n\n* Found in: [Depraved Chasm](/Depraved+Chasm \"Demons Souls Depraved Chasm\")\u00a0(Requires Pure White [World Tendency](/World+Tendency \"Demons Souls World Tendency\")).\u00a0About halfway across the ledge connecting the 2 areas there will be a ladder to your left.

In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nWithin plus or minus one minute, when was Marquinhos given a yellow card in the 2022 World Cup quarterfinals?
