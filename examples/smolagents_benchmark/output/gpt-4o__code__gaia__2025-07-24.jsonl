This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children\u2019s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children\u2019s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children\u2019s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons\u2019 intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children\u2019s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children\u2019s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.\n\n*Keywords*: Dragon, uncanny, Freud, children\u2019s literature\n\n*Biography*: Emily Midkiff (MA, English and Children\u2019s Literature) is teaching and working on her PhD at the University of Minnesota.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien once declared that \u201cthe dragon in legend is a potent creation of men\u2019s imagination, richer in significance than his barrow is in gold\u201d (\u201cThe Monsters\u201d 16). Dragons in mythology have come to be recognized for their value as representations of ancient cultures or as worldwide archetypes. Anthropologists have found and studied dragons in nearly all surviving mythologies; medievalists have examined them in manuscripts and bestiaries. In modern literature, dragons have flourished in their newer realm of fantasy and children\u2019s literature as one of its most pervasive mythic animals.\n\nYet within children\u2019s literature, scholars have noted a trend beginning even before the dragon\u2019s mass popularity in fantasy to soften and satirize the dragon for children. While this type of friendly dragon has become a well known resident of children\u2019s books, this article argues that children\u2019s literature dragons have been not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children\u2019s literature dragons.\n\nFluffy Dragons\n--------------\n\nIn comparison to ancient dragon lore, modern dragons for children inspire less terror and more laughter, beginning most noticeably with Kenneth Grahame\u2019s \u201cThe Reluctant Dragon\u201d in 1898. Ruth Stein in 1968 and Margaret Blount in 1974 both comment with distaste on the increasingly cuddly, \u201cfluffy\u201d nature of dragons in children\u2019s literature. In a short article for *Elementary Education*, Stein expresses hope that Tolkien\u2019s Smaug would improve the literary dragon\u2019s evolution and encourage properly scary dragons. While this has since proved true in part, the bemoaned fluffy dragons remain prevalent alongside Tolkien\u2019s menacing breed. Nonetheless Blount, in a later book, stipulates that as long as dragons retain their capability to inspire awe they could be less than terrifying and still remain \u201creal dragons\u201d (129). She points out several stories that fail to keep the awe of dragons alive, and most of the failures revolve around dragons that generally behave like humans and sometimes retain only one dragon characteristic, usually fire-breathing, in order to inspire conflict. Jon Stott, in 1990, shows less concern over what a \u201creal\u201d dragon is and even praises the proliferation of fluffy dragons, including Grahame\u2019s dragon, as parodies of the outdated cultural codes represented by traditional dragon lore (222-223). Hope Shastri\u2019s 1992 dissertation on the picture book dragon gives concrete results to support the observations of scholars like Stein, Blount, and Stott. Shastri performed a content analysis of 151 picture books produced between 1950 and 1992 in order to ascertain whether or not dragons have preserved their range of mythic capabilities in that form of children\u2019s literature. She divides picture book dragons into three categories: Household (the type that Blount accused of failure), Wildwood (untamed, living in the wild and closer to Tolkien\u2019s sort), and Imaginary (clearly pretend or a dream on the part of a child) and identifies thirty traditional dragon traits such as breathing fire, consuming humans, guarding treasure, talking, flying, and being vanquished. After applying these categories and traits to all 151 books, Shastri concludes that picture book dragons have effectively lost the majority of their original mythic qualities, save fire-breathing, and have largely become tame and meek\u2014especially the Household dragons, out of which she finds 86% to be denatured as opposed to 34% of Wildwood and 42% of Imaginary dragons (77). Tina L. Hanlon generally agrees with Shastri\u2019s findings in her own examination of 100 picture books in 2003, but she also notes with some hope the resurgence of strong dragons in retold fairy tales. In total, the work of these scholars over the past two decades indicates that dragons in children\u2019s books are increasingly humorous and less and less fearsome, just as Stein feared when she wrote over forty years ago.\n\nDragons and the Uncanny\n-----------------------\n\nThere may be more potent dragons lurking in children\u2019s literature than these observations and studies indicate, due to one significant aspect of Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The traits listed by Shastri focus on characteristics of the dragons themselves but do not include the emotional environment created by the dragon within the literature or with the audience. Stott acknowledges the fear inspired by traditional dragons due to their size and fierce temper, but his analysis addresses only the physical threat of the dragons and implies that this fear is entirely lost when parodied (224). Blount comes close to recognizing this deeper psychological effect of dragons when she writes that a quality children\u2019s literature dragon should still inspire awe. Awe and fear, yes, but the original dragons of Germanic lore from which children\u2019s literature dragons descended were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories.\n\nThis uncanny quality of these ancestral dragons derives from their unnatural similarity to the heroes who defeat them; the dragons are doubles for humanity. Joyce Tally Lionarons and Jonathan Evans, scholars of medieval dragon-lore, assert that dragons such as the famous F\u00e1fnir were terrifying and effective characters in epics because they vied with people for the right to be \u201chuman.\u201d According to the classic definition by Freud, the uncanny double occurs when \u201cone [person] possesses knowledge, feelings and experience in common with the other\u201d and is also sometimes \u201cmarked by the fact that the subject identifies himself with someone else, so that he is in doubt as to which his self is, or substitutes the extraneous self for his own\u201d (234).[1](#sdfootnote1sym) Freudian psychoanalysis has been applied to dragons in fairy tales by such scholars as Bruno Bettelheim, but he posits dragons as the dangerous, untamed id or the projection of oedipal issues by the child hero (76). Bettelheim\u2019s analysis also locates dragons as an internal hero conflict, which in many ways complements to my argument here, but I focus on Freud\u2019s concept of the uncanny rather than his superego-ego-id construct to explain the way that modern dragons can still unsettle readers even when the plot does not follow the traditional human hero questing to slay a physically fearsome dragon. Modern tamed and human-like children\u2019s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not life or ego-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire the uncanny doubling with humans: the dragons\u2019 intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech.\n\nThe remainder of this article will further explain how the dragon\u2019s potent powers of vision and language operate as uncanny traits, how vision and language are recognized by scholars of Germanic dragon-lore, and how these traits were translated into children\u2019s literature through such landmark texts as Grahame\u2019s *The Reluctant Dragon* and J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s Smaug in *The Hobbit* (1937). Finally, I will examine some examples of the uncanny vision and language of the dragons of modern children\u2019s literature through the middle-grade reader *How to Train Your Dragon Vol. 1* and the picture book *Hush, Little Dragon*. These books serve as purposeful case studies intended to represent recent English-language literature for the youngest to middle-grade readers. Each book was selected out of a pool of potential recent dragon books because they represent clear, but not extraordinary or unusual, examples of tamed and human-like dragons, respectively. I mean to ultimately use these texts to demonstrate that while many commonplace modern dragons have evolved away from their ancestors to good or bad effect, the visual potency and intimacy with language inherited from older dragons remain a potent, if largely invisible, means of creating uncanny dragons in children\u2019s literature. Stein and Blount protest the appearance of increasingly human dragons, but this very doubling has the potential to rescue the awe of dragons as long as they are just different and frightening enough to achieve the uncanny.\n\nThe Uncanny Dragon, Then and Now\n--------------------------------\n\nThe dragon\u2019s eyes hold much of its power, as well as its ability to inspire uncanny fear. In Freud\u2019s concept of the uncanny, the eyes are a frequent site of fear in two ways: as a displaced castration complex if the eyes are threatened, and as the evil-eye threatening oneself (231, 240). Colloquially considered windows to the soul, the eyes are also a significant cultural location for human identity. Likewise, the dragon\u2019s powerful eyes are one of its identifying features and greatest assets in its efforts to seize human identity. When discussing the Indo-European name for the dragon, Jonathan Evans says that the Greek root \u201c\\*drk-\u201d originally means \u201cto see, to watch\u201d and \u201c\\*drk-on\u201d would mean something like \u201cseeing one\u201d (\u201cAs Rare\u201d 23). Evans asserts that accordingly many Indo-European dragons are watchers and guarders responsible for keeping an eye on a treasure of some sort, and many have piercing or unnatural stares to discomfit potential attackers (23). The Greek dragon\u2019s name and identity is based on its power of sight. The \u201cunnatural\u201d stare that Evans mentions also creates an eerie sense of the intelligence behind the dragon\u2019s guardianship, a power and vision comparable if not superior to humanity\u2019s. The human hero is responsible for guarding the people, the dragon for guarding the treasure. Until one defeats the other, they are equally identified as powerful over-seers threatening one another\u2019s guardianship. Traditionally, when a hero faces and defeats a dragon, the slaying extinguishes the dragon\u2019s superior vision. In doing so, the hero establishes himself as the greater power and superior identity as watcher-guardian. This challenge over the hero\u2019s watcher-identity invokes the Freudian evil-eye or blindness as castration, making the dragon\u2019s threat to one\u2019s identity as watcher-guardian uncanny.\n\nAlongside the eyes, the dragon\u2019s uncanny powers manifest in its associations with speech. As far as we know, dragons are primarily imaginary creatures that emerged from within the oral and written realms of storytelling.[2](#sdfootnote2sym) In Western literature, they leapt into being as an invention of language and shortly after acquired, within stories, the ability to out-speak humans.[3](#sdfootnote3sym) In creating language-capable monsters proficient with the tools of linguistic creation, poets and bards fashioned in dragons a double for themselves: the dragon as wielder of language and the raw potential for language\u2014including the risk that language could escape human control and become dangerous. In this way dragons stole the human invention that created them and ventured uncomfortably close to humanity through the ability to speak with equal or superior eloquence. While other animals speak in legend and fairy tale, most of these creatures existed before language named them, and their words are simple and communicative. Dragons in contrast could not exist without language, and have a high language skill demonstrated through fondness for riddling talk and a tendency to use it aggressively.[4](#sdfootnote4sym) Furthermore, traditional dragons are notoriously evil where regular animals are not. Deirdre Dwen Pitts writes that folklore animals \u201cdate from the time when the world was not yet man-oriented and man and animal struggled together against uncontrollable natural forces\u201d (169). These animals are on the humans\u2019 side: \u201cAnimals are rarely the antagonists in these tales; enemies are usually undefined monsters, ogres, witches, giants, devils, demons, with only an occasional wolf\u201d (169). Oddly missing from this list are dragons, which are also frequent enemies and shadows of humanity. The dragon is, like the uncanny, that which \u201cought to have remained secret and hidden but has come to light\u201d (Freud 225). Many of the most terrifying and memorable dragons rely on their use of language to inspire fear and awe due to being distinctly unwelcome doubles for humanity.\n\nAlthough the dragon may imitate humanity through its roles as watcher and speaker, its physical properties keep it unfamiliar enough to be uncanny. The dragon\u2019s appearance comes down as inconsistent through European lore, but the medieval dragon is never nice-looking or aesthetically pleasing. This traditional dragon combines frightening and uncomfortable aspects taken from beasts who threaten humanity: snakes, big cats, and birds of prey.[5](#sdfootnote5sym) Therefore when this undesirable anti-human claims human identity, the thought becomes inherently unsettling to humans. Having this conglomeration of everything that one finds frightening and uncomfortable nearly become the same as oneself produces the uncanny doubling effect. Furthermore, Freud suggests that the familiar unfamiliar of the uncanny is the result of repressed experiences (241); accordingly many of these old stories imply that the dragon embodies the repressed dark side of the hero.\n\nIn the medieval Germanic dragon myths, the dragon watching over a hoard becomes an uncanny double for the hero watching over the people. In *Beowulf*, the poet uses identical words to describe the roles of Beowulf and the dragon. At different times he calls them both *agl\u00e6can*, meaning \u201cwarrior,\u201d and only context distinguishes the hero from the dragon (Lionarons 30). The same phrase *hordweard* or \u201choard-guardian\u201d refers to both. The dragon\u2019s lair is called a *dryhtsele*, the term used for a human king\u2019s hall (30). These examples of parallel naming reveal the doubled natures of hero and dragon as well as their conflicting positions. They perform the same job, but only one can succeed. In the inevitable conflict, the two guardians are so similar they nearly cancel one another out. Both kill one another; only narrowly does Beowulf come out on top as the successful overseer. By killing the dragon, he proves an effective guardian of his people from the dragon menace, but he also performs the final viewing and therefore possession of the dragon\u2019s treasure. The two concepts are connected, as the poet shows through Beowulf\u2019s insistence upon seeing the treasure before dying. When Wiglaf brings it to him, Beowulf gazes on it and says, \u201cI give thanks / that I behold this treasure here in front of me, / that I have been allowed to leave my people / so well endowed on the day I die\u201d (ln 2795-2798). He believes the treasure he has won could support his people, and therefore what the dragon has been watching over has been converted to a part of Beowulf\u2019s ward. His ability to look on the treasure assures him that he has won the ba\n..._This content has been truncated to stay below 40000 characters_...\ne less complicated realm of jokes and into full-blown riddling talk. He joins the sea dragon in philosophical pondering akin to Sigurd and F\u00e1fnir\u2019s wisdom poetry, but about the nature of death. The dragon here verbally accomplishes the feat of putting humans and dragons, regardless of size and status, on the same level: \u201cWe are all, in a sense, supper. . . . even a murderous carnivore like myself will be a supper for worms one day\u201d (151). Hiccup doesn\u2019t really win the battle of words to dismantle this similarity, but he does successfully avoid becoming consumed by the dragon by tiring him out with words. In his later encounter with the same giant dragon, Hiccup confronts his similarity to dragonkind more profoundly. After landing inside the giant dragon\u2019s mouth, he finds the dragon getting inside of him: \u201cThe terrible noise of the Dragon\u2019s heart beating had entered into Hiccup\u2019s chest and forced his own heart to follow the same rhythm\u201d (188-9). Hiccup finds himself blending into the dragon and losing his identity and willpower due to the dragon\u2019s digestive powers. This is a literal rendering of the threat to the identity of the Germanic hero during the dragon battle. Just as Tolkien\u2019s Smaug invades Bilbo\u2019s mind through manipulative language about the dwarves, the sea dragon threatens to invade Hiccup\u2019s mind to merge them into one being. Beforehand, the sea dragon and Hiccup were uncanny doubles because they each are thinking, speaking beings. At the moment that Hiccup hangs within the dragon\u2019s mouth, the hero and dragon nearly move beyond to become the same creature. The uncanny is the threat of this merge, the warning to stay away. By returning intact as his own person, Hiccup conquers the dragon psychologically before it is physically defeated. He resists the transformation and escapes, having defined himself by the willpower to live as the hero and the human.\n\nThe book resolves when the same difference is established on the side of the dragons. Toothless, after his heroism in rescuing Hiccup, is the first dragon to receive a human Viking burial. Hiccup, given his recent conquest over the dragon-assimiliation, does not approve of this complete blending. He has learned that dragons are different from humans in key ways and that bridging the gap is fine, but removing it is not. Because of this insight, Hiccup knows that treating Toothless as dead by human standards is inappropriate for he has not yet met dragon standards of death (a dragon will sing at and after its own death). Toothless learns to distinguish between bridging and merging too. Toothless tells himself, \u201cDragons are S-S-SELFISH . . . Dragons are heartless and have no mercy,\u201d even as he flies to the rescue of Hiccup and risks his own life (192). Despite this flouting of dragon rules, he does not entirely change. The final page features an illustration wherein Toothless amends his statement \u201cDragons are never grateful\u201d by scratching out the word \u201cnever\u201d and replacing it with \u201chardly ever\u201d (214). Hiccup and Toothless ultimately both acknowledge the similarity between dragons and humans, as well as its benefits, and come out as heroes because they retain the differences too. In this way the book nearly addresses the uncanny nature of dragons head on by dealing with the troublesome line between them, as is primarily demonstrated through language. The protagonist boy and dragon both learn to define themselves individually rather than purely through antagonism and fear of each other as doubles.\n\nHush, Little Dragon\n-------------------\n\nIn *Hush, Little Dragon*, the dragons\u2019 eyes and language infuse a relatively simple picture book with the uncanny. In this book, a mother dragon sings her baby to sleep with a modified version of \u201cHush, Little Baby.\u201d Instead of various gifts or pets, the dragon brings her baby various medieval persons for bedtime snacks. Eyes and language figure into this story subtly through the actual form of the book. The format itself is important because picture books were the specific subjects of Shastri\u2019s dissertation and Hanlon\u2019s later study, but in this case the function of picture book also facilitates the uncanny due to the dual audience. The format itself implies a parent reading out loud while a pre-literate child listens and observes the pictures. Nodelman does a particularly thorough job of exploring the commonly recognized duality inherent in picture books and \u201cthe relationship of an implied adult narrator to an implied nonadult narratee\u201d (444). As Nodelman notes, this relationship implies \u201can accompanying and paradoxical sense of a double addressee, both an implied child reader and an implied adult reader who chooses or shares the texts with the implied child; a focus on binary opposites like child and adult, home and away, good and evil, in theme and structure\u201d (444). Therefore, for my purposes here, it is significant to note that the parent is performing the language, the pre-literate child the eyes, and picture books already encourage a binary between these two age extremes. This dual performance brings the characteristics of the dragon uncomfortably close to home by doubling not only the people with the dragons but also the parent/child with one another.\n\nAdults and children are doubled and divided by the very practice in which they engage through picture books: literacy. John Morgenstern points out ever since children and adults were separated by the rise of schooling and the Victorian Cult of Childhood, children have been regarded by adults as another type of being that is simultaneously the same and different, innocent and barbaric (21-22). In *Hush, Little Dragon*, the parent and child readers each absorb the mother and child dragon identities, simultaneously taking on the dragon-humanity doubling and this cultural Othering between adults and children over the practice of reading.\n\nAs the performers of language, the reading parent becomes the mother dragon. Ashburn writes the book in the voice of the dragon mother. The book begins immediately with the lullaby words: \u201cHush, little dragon, don\u2019t make a sound\u201d (Ashburn 1). The parent reading or singing this lullaby out loud does not read any framing words like \u201cThe mother dragon is singing,\u201d but rather immediately joins in with the mother dragon. The sing-song rhythm of the text and the well-known tune that it corresponds with encourage the parent to actually sing the words and perform as the mother dragon. The goals of the mother dragon and parents even match, as parents traditionally read picture books to children at bedtime. Not only does this performance make the parent into the mother dragon from the child listener\u2019s point of view, but it also transforms the child into a dragon baby from the parent\u2019s point of view. Each is temporarily transformed into a dragon in the other\u2019s perspective through the performative language.\n\nMeanwhile the child and parent each see a different book; one focuses on observing the illustrations while the other focuses on reading the words. Of course both will notice the other aspect, but their expertise is distinctly divided. Picture book criticism has shown that children are generally more attentive to the images in books than adult readers and will catch many details while the parents remain focused on the words. In a study in which children were interviewed about how they read books, Arizpe and Styles affirmed that even the older children noticed less than the young (192). They explain this division as a \u201clearning function\u201d on the part of the children, thus \u201cchildren notice more details than adults do\u201d (193). Children and adults\u2019 areas of expertise further divide them into the eyes and language, accordingly.\n\nHence, adults may read a more lighthearted book than the children, for within the visual details of this book lie the most menacing parts. For instance, one spread portrays the mother dragon facing three musketeers. The words simply sing, \u201cIf those musketeers should bolt, / Mama\u2019s gonna stop their silly revolt\u201d (Ashburn 15). The words may refer to stopping the musketeers, but without much menace. The use of the word \u201csilly\u201d belittles their need to run away at all. The slightly forced use of the word \u201crevolt\u201d to rhyme with \u201cbolt\u201d implies more of a political maneuver than a dragon fight. In this way, the sing-song, rhyming style and somewhat absurd diction help dampen any potential scariness in the words.\n\nIn the picture, meanwhile, the musketeers cower against a wall as the dragon looms across the opposite page. The mother dragon is so large in comparison that she is not contained within the frame of the spread, creating a character menacing in pure size. Additionally, her position reveals an animal threat to the musketeers as she puts forward her head and bares her teeth. In the case of a dragon, this is also a threat of fire. Meanwhile, the baby dragon gleefully reaches for the terrified musketeers. No consumption is shown in the picture, but the next page features a little musketeer hat on the ground between the mother and the baby, with no owner in sight. Several pages later, one lonely musketeer stands on the top of a tower as the mother and son fly away. The book never shows the baby actually eating these people, and it would be easy to assume that they are all getting away if it weren\u2019t for these little visual details underscoring their fate. As the child watches the pictures, where the people being threatened appear terrified or angry, the parent reads light, absurd words and rhymes. Only at the end when the mother sings that the baby\u2019s \u201ctummy is full you must be done!\u201d (Ashburn 23) do the words affirm that the baby really has been consuming many of the people. Effectively, the child in this situation would experience being cheerfully sung to while several people die but at the same time, the child is being addressed in second person as though he or she was the baby dragon. The dragons become more familiar than the humans, and in the end this familiarity creates a question of alliance and identity. While the eyes of the dragons or even the readers are not being threatened, as in the traditional uncanny, the collective visual and verbal information which the child collects is in its own way threatening to human bodies and identities. The child is given an uncertain doubling between dragon and human that brings up the question of which the child truly is or, perhaps more importantly, wishes to be.\n\nAshburn\u2019s rhyming lyrics and Murphy\u2019s illustrations present the dragon as uncanny, but in a delightful fashion. The end result of this is not fear, but rather amusement. *Hush, Little Dragon* follows Grahame\u2019s tradition of keeping the menace subtle and beneath a pleasant surface. Even though the pictures imply several murders, the dragons are not terrifying. Their pleasantly rounded and curvy bodies appear cuddly, especially next to the generally angular and uncomfortable looking humans. In the spread with the musketeers, the mother dragon may be threatening them, but her teeth, horns, spikes, and other scary features are curvy in stark contrast to the musketeers\u2019 pointy tunics, mustaches, hats, and swords. The disparity comes off as funny, of course, but also creepy as it once again aligns the readers\u2019 sympathy with the dragons.\n\n*Hush, Little Dragon* relies on form to reveal the uncanny in part due to the constraints and strengths of its genre as a picture book. The chapter book *How to Train Your Dragon Book 1* has fewer such format-based codes to manipulate, and so the uncanny occurs in the words. Through different means, the texts mask the uncanny with humor and satire of traditional dragons. The uncanny is present, a lurking dark side to dragons, but they are allowed to be funny and retain their fearsome power simultaneously.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nBetween the lighthearted dragon-lore attitude attributed to Grahame and the identity-disturbing aspects translated by Tolkien, dragons in literature still have access to their mythic capabilities. Stein, Blount, Shastri and Hanlon put the awe-inspiring aspects of mythical dragons into opposition with the humorous qualities of many children\u2019s literature dragons, yet humor and the uncanny need not negate each other. Grahame\u2019s style of humor may be just the right protective camouflage for Tolkien-esque fearsome dragons. Using seemingly innocent traits such as eyes and language, some authors sneak in the old power of dragons, whether or not they are even aware of the traditions that they uphold. Dragons in modern children\u2019s literature can still inspire the fear of the uncanny double, the uneasy proximity of another being that could eclipse oneself, carried from their ancestral dragon-lore. While not all take advantage of this option, and plenty of empty neighbor-dragons exist in children\u2019s literature, it is important to remember that not all of those dragons may be as innocent as appearances would imply. A little riddling talk might bring out an entirely different (but eerily similar) beast.\n\n### Notes\n\n[1.](#sdfootnote1anc) Admittedly, Freud dismisses fantastic tales as potential hosts for the uncanny, saying \u201cI cannot think of any genuine fairy story which has anything uncanny about it\u201d (246). However, many scholars before me have disregarded this qualification of the uncanny and applied it to fantasy and fairy tales alike. See Peter Straub\u2019s \u201cAmerican Fantastic Tales: Terror and the Uncanny from Poe to the Pulps\u201d for an overview of the uncanny in fantastic American stories or David Rudd\u2019s \u201cAn Eye for an I: Neil Gaiman\u2019s Coraline and Questions of Identity\u201d for a more specific application of Freud\u2019s uncanny to a fantasy text.\n\n[2.](#sdfootnote2anc) See Grafton Elliot Smith\u2019s *The Evolution of the Dragon*, Charles Gould\u2019s *Dragons, Unicorns, and Sea Serpents: A Classic Study of the Evidence for their Existence*, Ernest Ingersoll\u2019s *Dragons and Dragon Lore*, and David E. Jones\u2019s *An Instinct for Dragons* for an overview of the classic and updated debates on where the dragon in myth came from, whether or not it ever existed, and how it spread across the world.\n\n[3.](#sdfootnote3anc) The oldest proto-dragons were mythic characters like the Babylonian Tiamat, a goddess who could of course speak. However, this paper largely concerns Western dragons from the point when we can culturally recognize them as dragons. It is at this point that the dragon\u2019s relationship with language becomes noticeable and also problematic.\n\n[4.](#sdfootnote4anc) The sphinx and trolls, other frequently riddling creatures, are recognized as proto-dragons. See the work of Charles Gould and Ernest Ingersoll in works cited.\n\n[5.](#sdfootnote5anc) Smith uses this combination of predator traits as the foundation for his theory that dragons result from residual predator-prey instincts left over from the evolution of humanity. In his book, he details how these attributes are present in every mythological dragon in every culture across the world.\n\n### Works Cited\n\nArizpe, Evelyn and Morag Styles. *Children Reading Pictures: Interpreting Visual Texts*.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of \u0218irnea have been turned into vampires?"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical consistency of the statements made by the villagers.\n\nThought: We have 100 residents in the village of \u0218irnea. Each resident says, \"At least one of us is a human.\" We know two key facts:\n1. Humans always tell the truth.\n2. Vampires always lie.\n\nLet's break down the implications of the statement:\n- If a human says, \"At least one of us is a human,\" it is a true statement. This means there must be at least one human in the village.\n- If a vampire says, \"At least one of us is a human,\" it is a false statement. This would imply there are no humans in the village.\n\nSince everyone in the village gives the same response, and that response is consistent with the truth a human would utter, there must be at least one human among the residents. Otherwise, if everyone were a vampire, their statement would be false because all vampires would have to claim something untrue, but here they indicate the presence of humans.\n\nThus, there can't be all 100 residents as vampires. The presence of at least one human confirms the truthfulness that not all are vampires.\n\nConclusion: There is exactly one human in the village, which means 99 residents must have been turned into vampires.\n\n<code>\nfinal_answer(99)\n</code>"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_1', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'python_interpreter', 'arguments': 'final_answer(99)'}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nExecution logs:\nLast output from code snippet:\n99"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}], "start_time": 1753384567.0735521, "end_time": "2025-07-24 21:16:21", "token_counts": {"input_tokens": 2286, "output_tokens": 277, "total_tokens": 2563}}

Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

who was popular throughout [Latin America](/wiki/Latin_America \"Latin America\") and many countries outside the region. With her roots in [Argentine folk music](/wiki/Folk_music_of_Argentina \"Folk music of Argentina\"), Sosa became one of the preeminent exponents of *El nuevo cancionero*. She gave voice to songs written by many Latin American songwriters. Her music made people hail her as the \"voice of the voiceless ones\".[[2]](#cite_note-tmc-2) She was often called \"the conscience of Latin America\".[[3]](#cite_note-Heckman-3)\n\nSosa performed in venues such as the [Lincoln Center](/wiki/Lincoln_Center \"Lincoln Center\") in New York City, the [Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Mogador](/wiki/Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre_Mogador \"Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Mogador\") in Paris, the [Sistine Chapel](/wiki/Sistine_Chapel \"Sistine Chapel\") in Vatican City, as well as sold-out shows in New York's [Carnegie Hall](/wiki/Carnegie_Hall \"Carnegie Hall\") and the Roman [Colosseum](/wiki/Colosseum \"Colosseum\") during her final decade of life. Her career spanned four decades and she was the recipient of six [Latin Grammy](/wiki/Latin_Grammy \"Latin Grammy\") awards (2000, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2011), including a [Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award](/wiki/Latin_Grammy_Lifetime_Achievement_Award \"Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award\") in 2004 and two posthumous [Latin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album](/wiki/Latin_Grammy_Award_for_Best_Folk_Album \"Latin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album\") in 2009 and 2011. She won the [Premio Gardel](/wiki/Premios_Gardel \"Premios Gardel\") in 2000, the main musical award in Argentina. She served as an ambassador for [UNICEF](/wiki/UNICEF \"UNICEF\").\n\nLife\n----\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mercedes_Sosa&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Life\")]\n\nSosa was born on 9 July 1935, in [San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n](/wiki/San_Miguel_de_Tucum%C3%A1n \"San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n\"), in the [northwestern Argentine](/wiki/Argentine_Northwest \"Argentine Northwest\") province of [Tucum\u00e1n](/wiki/Tucum%C3%A1n_Province \"Tucum\u00e1n Province\"), of [mestizo](/wiki/Mestizo \"Mestizo\") ancestry. She was of French, Spanish and [Diaguita](/wiki/Diaguita \"Diaguita\") descent.[[4]](#cite_note-Legendary_folk_singer_Mercedes_Sosa_dies_at_74-4) Her nickname \"la negra\", which is a common nickname in Argentina for people with darker complexion, is a reference to her indigenous heritage.[[5]](#cite_note-:0-5) Her parents, a day laborer and a washerwoman,[[3]](#cite_note-Heckman-3) were [Peronists](/wiki/Peronism \"Peronism\"), although they never registered in the party, and she started her career as a singer for the [Peronist Party](/wiki/Peronist_Party \"Peronist Party\") in [Tucuman](/wiki/Tucum%C3%A1n_Province \"Tucum\u00e1n Province\") under the name Gladys Osorio.[[6]](#cite_note-6) In 1950, at age fifteen, she won a singing competition organized by a local radio station and was given a contract to perform for two months.[[7]](#cite_note-Mercedes_Sosa:_Obituary-7) She recorded her first album, *[La Voz de la Zafra](/wiki/La_voz_de_la_zafra \"La voz de la zafra\")*, in 1959.[[7]](#cite_note-Mercedes_Sosa:_Obituary-7) A performance at the 1965 [Cosqu\u00edn National Folklore Festival](/wiki/Cosqu%C3%ADn_Festival \"Cosqu\u00edn Festival\")\u2014where she was introduced and brought to the stage while sitting in the audience by fellow folk singer [Jorge Cafrune](/wiki/Jorge_Cafrune \"Jorge Cafrune\")\u2014[[8]](#cite_note-test-8) brought her to the attention of the Argentine public.[[7]](#cite_note-Mercedes_Sosa:_Obituary-7) Sosa and her first husband, [Manuel Oscar Matus](/w/index.php?title=Manuel_Oscar_Matus&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Manuel Oscar Matus (page does not exist)\"), with whom she had one son, were key players in the mid-60s *[nueva canci\u00f3n](/wiki/Nueva_canci%C3%B3n \"Nueva canci\u00f3n\")* movement (which was called *nuevo cancionero* in Argentina).[[9]](#cite_note-Latin_artist_Mercedes_Sosa_dies-9) Her second record was *Canciones con Fundamento*, a collection of Argentine folk songs.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Mercedes_Sosa%2C_F%C3%A9lix_Luna_y_Ariel_Ram%C3%ADrez.jpg/250px-Mercedes_Sosa%2C_F%C3%A9lix_Luna_y_Ariel_Ram%C3%ADrez.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mercedes_Sosa,_F%C3%A9lix_Luna_y_Ariel_Ram%C3%ADrez.jpg)\n\nSosa with [F\u00e9lix Luna](/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Luna \"F\u00e9lix Luna\") and [Ariel Ram\u00edrez](/wiki/Ariel_Ram%C3%ADrez \"Ariel Ram\u00edrez\") (at the piano)\n\nSosa \"spent the late 1960s building her audience in Europe and among the cosmopolitan middle class in Buenos Aires, becoming in the process a much bigger star\" than her contemporaries.[[10]](#cite_note-10) In 1967, Sosa toured the United States and Europe with great success.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")*] In later years, she performed and recorded extensively, broadening her repertoire to include material from throughout Latin America.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Sosa released two concept albums in collaboration with composer [Ariel Ram\u00edrez](/wiki/Ariel_Ram%C3%ADrez \"Ariel Ram\u00edrez\") and lyricist [F\u00e9lix Luna](/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Luna \"F\u00e9lix Luna\"): *Cantata Sudamericana* and *Mujeres Argentinas* (Argentine Women). She also recorded a tribute to Chilean musician [Violeta Parra](/wiki/Violeta_Parra \"Violeta Parra\") in 1971, including what was to become one of Sosa's signature songs, *[Gracias a la vida](/wiki/Gracias_a_la_vida \"Gracias a la vida\")*.[[4]](#cite_note-Legendary_folk_singer_Mercedes_Sosa_dies_at_74-4)[[11]](#cite_note-ap-11) She further popularized of songs written by [Milton Nascimento](/wiki/Milton_Nascimento \"Milton Nascimento\") of Brazil and [Pablo Milan\u00e9s](/wiki/Pablo_Milan%C3%A9s \"Pablo Milan\u00e9s\") and [Silvio Rodr\u00edguez](/wiki/Silvio_Rodr%C3%ADguez \"Silvio Rodr\u00edguez\") both from [Cuba](/wiki/Cuba \"Cuba\").[[4]](#cite_note-Legendary_folk_singer_Mercedes_Sosa_dies_at_74-4) Throughout the decade, she released albums such as *Hasta la Victoria* in 1972 and *Traigo un Pueblo* *en mi Voz* in 1973. They featured songs like \"Cuando tenga la tierra\", written by [Ariel Petrocelli](/w/index.php?title=Ariel_Petrocelli&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Ariel Petrocelli (page does not exist)\") and Daniel Toro, which tackles political and social issues like wealth and land inequality.[[12]](#cite_note-:2-12)[[13]](#cite_note-13) During the 1970s she was a part of two films by the director [Leopoldo Torre Nilsson](/wiki/Leopoldo_Torre_Nilsson \"Leopoldo Torre Nilsson\"): *[El Santo de la Espada](/wiki/El_Santo_de_la_Espada \"El Santo de la Espada\")* in 1970 and *[G\u00fcemes, la tierra en armas](/wiki/G%C3%BCemes:_la_tierra_en_armas \"G\u00fcemes: la tierra en armas\")* in 1971, in which she portrayed [Juana Azurduy de Padilla](/wiki/Juana_Azurduy_de_Padilla \"Juana Azurduy de Padilla\"), the guerrilla military leader who fought for Argentine independence.[[12]](#cite_note-:2-12)[[14]](#cite_note-14)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Mercedes_Sosa_2.jpg/250px-Mercedes_Sosa_2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mercedes_Sosa_2.jpg)\n\nSosa in 1972\n\nAfter the [military junta](/wiki/National_Reorganization_Process \"National Reorganization Process\") of [Jorge Videla](/wiki/Jorge_Videla \"Jorge Videla\") came to power in 1976, the atmosphere in Argentina grew increasingly oppressive. Sosa faced death threats against both her and her family, but refused for many years to leave the country. At a concert in [La Plata](/wiki/La_Plata \"La Plata\") in 1979, Sosa was searched and arrested on stage, along with all those attending the concert.[[9]](#cite_note-Latin_artist_Mercedes_Sosa_dies-9) Their release came about through international intervention.[[7]](#cite_note-Mercedes_Sosa:_Obituary-7) Despite attempts to hold more concerts, she was officially barred from performing by the military regime.[[5]](#cite_note-:0-5) Banned in her own country, she moved to Paris and then to [Madrid](/wiki/Madrid \"Madrid\").[[7]](#cite_note-Mercedes_Sosa:_Obituary-7)[[9]](#cite_note-Latin_artist_Mercedes_Sosa_dies-9) She has spoken publicly about her artistic and emotional struggles during this period of her life.[[5]](#cite_note-:0-5) While in exile, she released the album *A Quien Doy* in 1981. The album included a recording of the song \"Cuando Me Acuerdo de Mi Pais\" which was originally written by the prolific Chilean singer/songwriter, [Patricio Manns](/wiki/Patricio_Manns \"Patricio Manns\"). The song, which he wrote while also in political exile, expresses the sorrow he felt from being separated from his homeland.[[15]](#cite_note-15) She related to this feeling and struggled to continue recording and performing. In an interview with the New York Times, she said, \u201cIt was a mental problem, a problem of morale...It wasn\u2019t my throat, or anything physical\".[[5]](#cite_note-:0-5)\n\nSosa returned to

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nWho did the actor who played Ray in the Polish-language version of Everybody Loves Raymond play in Magda M.?

The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nI'm making a grocery list for my mom, but she's a professor of botany and she's a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things.

DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nIn Audre Lorde\u2019s poem \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost\u201d, what is the number of the stanza in which some lines are indented?"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "**Thought:** To determine the number of the stanza with indented lines in Audre Lorde's poem \"Father Son and Holy Ghost,\" I need to find and examine the text of the poem.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform.

Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nWhat country had the least number of athletes at the 1928 Summer Olympics?

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nWhat is the first name of the only Malko Competition recipient from the 20th Century (after 1977) whose nationality on record is a country that no longer exists?"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "**Thought:** To find the first name of the only Malko Competition recipient from the 20th Century (after 1977) whose nationality on record is a country that no longer exists, I need to perform the following steps:\n1.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9.

The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nWhat was the complete title of the book in which two James Beard Award winners recommended the restaurant where Ali Khan enjoyed a New Mexican staple in his cost-conscious TV show that started in 2015?

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results.

He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nWhat is the surname of the equine veterinarian mentioned in 1.E Exercises from the chemistry materials licensed by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew under the CK-12 license in LibreText's Introductory Chemistry materials as compiled 08/21/2023?"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "To find the surname of the equine veterinarian mentioned in LibreText's Introductory Chemistry materials, I need to search for the document that contains the specific section \"1.E Exercises\" from the materials authored by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew.

first two questions. In 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming was studying Staphylococcus bacteria growing in culture dishes. He noticed that a mold called Penicillium was also growing in some of the dishes. In Figure 1.13, Petri dish A represents a dish containing only Staphylococcus bacteria. The red dots in dish B represent Penicillium colonies. Fleming noticed that a clear area existed around the mold because all the bacteria grown in this area had died. In the culture dishes without the mold, no clear areas were present. Fleming suggested that the mold was producing a chemical that killed the bacteria. He decided to isolate this substance and test it to see if it would kill bacteria. Fleming grew some Penicillium mold in a nutrient broth. After the mold grew in the broth, he removed all the mold from the broth and added the broth to a culture of bacteria. All the bacteria died.\n\n1. Which of the following statements is a reasonable expression of Fleming\u2019s hypothesis?\n   1. Nutrient broth kills bacteria.\n   2. There are clear areas around the Penicillium mold where Staphylococcus doesn't grow.\n   3. Mold kills bacteria.\n   4. Penicillium mold produces a substance that kills Staphylococcus.\n   5. Without mold in the culture dish, there were no clear areas in the bacteria.\n2. Fleming grew Penicillium in broth, then removed the Penicillium and poured the broth into culture dishes containing bacteria to see if the broth would kill the bacteria. What step in the scientific method does this represent?\n   1. Collecting and organizing data\n   2. Making a hypothesis\n   3. Testing a hypothesis by experiment\n   4. Rejecting the old hypothesis and making a new one\n   5. None of these\n\nA scientific investigation is NOT valid unless every step in the scientific method is present and carried out in the exact order listed in this chapter.\n\n1. True\n2. False\n\nWhich of the following words is closest to the same meaning as *hypothesis*?\n\n1. fact\n2. law\n3. formula\n4. suggestion\n5. conclusion\n\nWhy do scientists sometimes discard theories?\n\n1. the steps in the scientific method were not followed in order\n2. public opinion disagrees with the theory\n3. the theory is opposed by the church\n4. contradictory observations are found\n5. congress voted against it\n\nGary noticed that two plants which his mother planted on the same day, that were the same size when planted, were different in size after three weeks. Since the larger plant was in the full sun all day and the smaller plant was in the shade of a tree most of the day, Gary believed the sunshine was responsible for the difference in the plant sizes. In order to test this, Gary bought ten small plants of the same size and type. He made sure they had the same size and type of pot. He also made sure they had the same amount and type of soil. Then Gary built a frame to hold a canvas roof over five of the plants while the other five were nearby but out in the sun. Gary was careful to make sure that each plant received exactly the same amount of water and plant food every day.\n\n1. Which of the following is a reasonable statement of Gary\u2019s hypothesis?\n   1. Different plants have different characteristics.\n   2. Plants that get more sunshine grow larger than plants that get less sunshine.\n   3. Plants that grow in the shade grow larger.\n   4. Plants that don\u2019t receive water will die.\n   5. Plants that receive the same amount of water and plant food will grow the same amount.\n2. What scientific reason might Gary have for insisting that the container size for the all plants be the same?\n   1. Gary wanted to determine if the size of the container would affect the plant growth.\n   2. Gary wanted to make sure the size of the container did not affect differential plant growth in his experiment.\n   3. Gary want to control how much plant food his plants received.\n   4. Gary wanted his garden to look organized.\n   5. There is no possible scientific reason for having the same size containers.\n3. What scientific reason might Gary have for insisting that all plants receive the same amount of water everyday?\n   1. Gary wanted to test the effect of shade on plant growth and therefore, he wanted to have no variables other than the amount of sunshine on the plants.\n   2. Gary wanted to test the effect of the amount of water on plant growth.\n   3. Gary's hypothesis was that water quality was affecting plant growth.\n   4. Gary was conserving water.\n   5. There is no possible scientific reason for having the same amount of water for each plant every day.\n4. What was the variable being tested in Gary's experiment?\n   1. the amount of water\n   2. the amount of plant food\n   3. the amount of soil\n   4. the amount of sunshine\n   5. the type of soil\n5. Which of the following factors may be varying in Gary\u2019s experimental setup that he did not control?\n   1. individual plant variation\n   2. soil temperature due to different colors of containers\n   3. water loss due to evaporation from the soil\n   4. the effect of insects which may attack one set of plants but not the other\n   5. All of the above are possible factors that Gary did not control.\n\nWhen a mosquito sucks blood from its host, it penetrates the skin with its sharp beak and injects an anti-coagulant so the blood will not clot. It then sucks some blood and removes its beak. If the mosquito carries disease-causing microorganisms, it injects these into its host along with the anti-coagulant. It was assumed for a long time that the virus typhus was injected by the louse when sucking blood in a manner similar to the mosquito. But apparently this is not so. The infection is not in the saliva of the louse, but in the feces. The disease is thought to be spread when the louse feces come in contact with scratches or bite wounds in the host's skin. A test of this was carried out in 1922 when two workers fed infected lice on a monkey, taking great care that no louse feces came into contact with the monkey. After two weeks, the monkey had NOT become ill with typhus. The workers then injected the monkey with typhus and it became ill within a few days. Why did the workers inject the monkey with typhus near the end of the experiment?\n\n1. to prove that the lice carried the typhus virus\n2. to prove the monkey was similar to man\n3. to prove that the monkey was not immune to typhus\n4. to prove that mosquitoes were not carriers of typhus\n5. the workers were mean\n\nEijkman fed a group of chickens exclusively on rice whose seed coat had been removed (polished rice or white rice). The chickens all developed polyneuritis (a disease of chickens) and died. He fed another group of chickens unpolished rice (rice that still had its seed coat). Not a single one of them contracted polyneuritis. He then gathered the polishings from rice (the seed coats that had been removed) and fed the polishings to other chickens that were sick with polyneuritis. In a short time, the birds all recovered. Eijkman had accurately traced the cause of polyneuritis to a faulty diet. For the first time in history, a food deficiency disease had been produced and cured experimentally. Which of the following is a reasonable statement of Eijkman\u2019s hypothesis?\n\n1. Polyneuritis is a fatal disease for chickens.\n2. White rice carries a virus for the disease polyneuritis.\n3. Unpolished rice does not carry the polyneuritis virus.\n4. The rice seed coat contains a nutrient that provides protection for chickens against polyneuritis.\n5. None of these is a reasonable statement of Eijkman's hypothesis.\n\nThe three questions below relate to the following paragraphs.\n\nScientist A noticed that in a certain forest area, the only animals inhabiting the region were giraffes. He also noticed that the only food available for the animals was on fairly tall trees and as the summer progressed, the animals ate the leaves high and higher on the trees. The scientist suggested that these animals were originally like all other animals but generations of animals stretching their necks to reach higher up the trees for food, caused the species to grow very long necks.\n\nScientist B conducted experiments and observed that stretching muscles does NOT cause bones to grow longer nor change the DNA of animals so that longer muscles would be passed on to the next generation. Scientist B, therefore, discarded Scientist A's suggested answer as to why all the animals living in the area had long necks. Scientist B suggested instead that originally many different types of animals including giraffes had lived in the region but only the giraffes could survive when the only food was high in the trees, and so all the other species had left the area.\n\n1. Which of the following statements is an interpretation, rather than an observation?\n   1. The only animals living in the area were giraffes.\n   2. The only available food was on tall trees.\n   3. Animals which constantly stretch their necks will grow longer necks.\n   4. A, B, and C are all interpretations.\n   5. A, B, and C are all observations.\n2. Scientist A's hypothesis was that\n   1. the only animals living in the area were giraffes.\n   2. the only available food was on tall trees.\n   3. animals which constantly stretch their necks will grow longer necks.\n   4. the animals which possess the best characteristics for living in an area, will be the predominant species.\n   5. None of the above are reasonable statements of Scientist A's hypothesis.\n3. Scientist A's hypothesis being discarded is\n   1. evidence that the scientific method doesn\u2019t always work.\n   2. a result achieved without use of the scientific method.\n   3. an example of what happened before the scientific method was invented.\n   4. an example of the normal functioning of the scientific method.\n   5. an unusual case.\n\nWhen a theory has been known for a long time, it becomes a law.\n\n1. True\n2. False\n\nDuring Pasteur's time, anthrax was a widespread and disastrous disease for livestock. Many people whose livelihood was raising livestock lost large portions of their herds to this disease. Around 1876, a horse doctor in eastern France named Louvrier, claimed to have invented a cure for anthrax. The influential men of the community supported Louvrier's claim to have cured hundreds of cows of anthrax. Pasteur went to Louvrier's hometown to evaluate the cure. The cure was explained to Pasteur as a multi-step process during which: 1) the cow was rubbed vigorously to make her as hot as possible; 2) long gashes were cut into the cows skin and turpentine was poured into the cuts; 3) an inch-thick coating of cow manure mixed with hot vinegar was plastered onto the cow and the cow was completely wrapped in a cloth. Since some cows recover from anthrax with no treatment, performing the cure on a single cow would not be conclusive, so Pasteur proposed an experiment to test Louvrier's cure. Four healthy cows were to be injected with anthrax microbes, and after the cows became ill, Louvrier would pick two of the cows (A and B) and perform his cure on them while the other two cows (C and D) would be left untreated. The experiment was performed and after a few days, one of the untreated cows died and one of them got better. Of the cows treated by Louvrier's cure, one cow died and one got better. In this experiment, what was the purpose of infecting cows C and D?\n\n1. So that Louvrier would have more than two cows to choose from.\n2. To make sure the injection actually contained anthrax.\n3. To serve as experimental controls (a comparison of treated to untreated cows).\n4. To kill as many cows as possible.\n\nA hypothesis is\n\n1. a description of a consistent pattern in observations.\n2. an observation that remains constant.\n3. a theory that has been proven.\n4. a tentative explanation for a phenomenon.\n\nA number of people became ill after eating oysters in a restaurant. Which of the following statements is a hypothesis about this occurrence?\n\n1. Everyone who ate oysters got sick.\n2. People got sick whether the oysters they ate were raw or cooked.\n3. Symptoms included nausea and dizziness.\n4. The cook felt really bad about it.\n5. Bacteria in the oysters may have caused the illness.\n\nWhich statement best describes the reason for using experimental controls?\n\n1. Experimental controls eliminate the need for large sample sizes.\n2. Experimental controls eliminate the need for statistical tests.\n3. Experimental controls reduce the number of measurements needed.\n4. Experimental controls allow comparison between groups that are different in only one independent variable.\n\nA student decides to set up an experiment to determine the relationship between the growth rate of plants and the presence of detergent in the soil. He sets up 10 seed pots. In five of the seed pots, he mixes a precise amount of detergent with the soil and the other five seed pots have no detergent in the soil. The five seed pots with detergent are placed in the sun and the five seed pots with no detergent are placed in the shade. All 10 seed pots receive the same amount of water and the same number and type of seeds. He grows the plants for two months and charts the growth every two days. What is wrong with his experiment?\n\n1. The student has too few pots.\n2. The student has two independent variables.\n3. The student has two dependent variables.\n4. The student has no experimental control on the soil.\n\nA scientist plants two rows of corn for experimentation. She puts fertilizer on row 1 but does not put fertilizer on row 2. Both rows receive the same amount of sun and water. She checks the growth of the corn over the course of five months. What is acting as the control in this experiment?\n\n1. Corn without fertilizer.\n2. Corn with fertilizer.\n3. Amount of water.\n4. Height of corn plants.\n\nIf you have a control group for your experiment, which of the following is true?\n\n1. There can be more than one difference between the control group and the test group, but not more three differences, or else the experiment is invalid.\n2. The control group and the test group may have many differences between them.\n3. The control group must be identical to the test group except for one variable.\n4. None of these are true.\n\nIf the hypothesis is rejected by the experiment, then:\n\n1. the experiment may have been a success.\n2. the experiment was a failure.\n3. the experiment was poorly designed.\n4. the experiment didn't follow the scientific method.\n\nA well-substantiated explanation of an aspect of the natural world is a:\n\n1. theory.\n2. law.\n3. hypothesis.\n4. None of these.\n\n[1.5: A Beginning Chemist: How to Succeed](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Chemistry/Introductory_Chemistry_(LibreTexts)/01%3A_The_Chemical_World/1.05%3A_A_Beginning_Chemist_-_How_to_Succeed \"Textbook_Maps/Introductory_Chemistry_TextMaps/Map:_Introductory_Chemistry_(Tro)/01:_The_Chemical_World/1.5:_A_Beginning_Chemist:_How_to_Succeed\")\n\n---\n\n[1.E: Exercises](https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Chabot_College/Introduction_to_General_Organic_and_Biochemistry/01%3A_Chemistry_in_our_Lives/1.E%3A_Exercises) is shared under a [CK-12](https://www.ck12info.org/curriculum-materials-license)  license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew.\n\n[![CK-12 Foundation](https://www.ck12.org/media/common/images/logo_ck12.svg)](https://www.ck12.org/)\n\nLICENSED UNDER\n\n[![CK-12 Foundation is licensed under CK-12 Curriculum Materials License](https://www.ck12.org/media/images/ck12-license.svg \"CK-12 Foundation is licensed under CK-12 Curriculum Materials License\")](https://www.ck12info.org/curriculum-materials-license/)\n\n1.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9.

Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nConsider the following symbols: \ud809\udc1c  \ud809\udc10\ud809\udc1a\n\nThis is a number written using the Mesopotamian/Babylonian number system and represented with Sumerian cuneiform.

The sign \ud809\udc1a represents something like \"six GE\u01602\", which would typically account for a base-60 component in cuneiform number representation.\n\nGiven these translations, it's clear that these symbols would represent a composite base-60 numeral. We have:\n\n- \ud809\udc1c (eight GE\u01602), typically representing a grouping by 3600, suggesting some multiplication involving 3600.\n- \ud809\udc10\ud809\udc1a is like a concatenation of \"50\" and its related sexagesimal positional value, following its GE\u01602 representation.\n\nThe list I extracted could be of great assistance. Let's convert using this:\n\n1. \\( \\text{\ud809\udc1a}: 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\)\n2. \\( \\text{\ud809\udc10}: 50 \\)\n3. \\( \\text{\ud809\udc1c}: (8 \\times 1) = 8 \\)\n\nFirstly, let's consider this structure mapped onto the systematic Babylonian number system: \\( 8 \\times 3600 + 360 + 50 \\).\n\n<code>\nnumber_decimal = 8 * 3600 + 360 + 50\nfinal_answer(number_decimal)\n</code>"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-call", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Calling tools:\n[{'id': 'call_3', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'python_interpreter', 'arguments': 'number_decimal = 8 * 3600 + 360 + 50\\nfinal_answer(number_decimal)'}}]"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Observation:\nExecution logs:\nLast output from code snippet:\n29210"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}], "start_time": 1753384622.384446, "end_time": "2025-07-24 21:17:21", "token_counts": {"input_tokens": 22253, "output_tokens": 604, "total_tokens": 22857}}

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Studies show that the recycling rate for beverage containers is vastly increased with a bottle bill. The United States' overall beverage container recycling rate is approximately 33%, while states with container deposit laws have a 70% average rate of beverage container recycling. Michigan's recycling rate of 97% from 1990 to 2008 was the highest in the nation, as is its $0.10 deposit.[[2]](#cite_note-Gitlitz-2) Numerous instances of criminal offenses motivated by the cash refund value of empty containers have been reported.\n\nProponents of container deposit legislation have pointed to the small financial responsibilities of the states. Financing these programs are the responsibility of the beverage industry and consumers.[[2]](#cite_note-Gitlitz-2) Producers are responsible for disposing of returned products, while consumers are responsible for collecting their refunds.\n\nIn Connecticut, Maine, Michigan, and Massachusetts the courts have ruled that unclaimed deposits are deemed abandoned by the public and are therefore property of the state. In California and Hawaii uncollected deposits are used to cover the administrative costs of the deposit program.[[2]](#cite_note-Gitlitz-2)[[3]](#cite_note-3) In Iowa and Oregon the beverage distribution industry keeps the unredeemed deposits.[[4]](#cite_note-4)[[5]](#cite_note-:0-5) Iowa and Oregon's systems are similar and it was found to be highly profitable for beverage distributors in Iowa.[[5]](#cite_note-:0-5) Between March 11, 2020, and June 2020, most states with container deposit legislation, except for California and Hawaii, temporarily suspended the bottle bill requirements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[[6]](#cite_note-6)\n\n| States first enacting a bottle bill[[7]](#cite_note-7)[[8]](#cite_note-8) |\n| --- |\n| | year | state | | --- | --- | | 1971 | Oregon | | 1972 | Vermont | | 1976 | Maine | | 1976 | Michigan | | 1978 | Connecticut | | 1978 | Iowa | | 1982 | Massachusetts | | 1982 | New York | | 1986 | California | | 2002 | Hawaii | |\n\nUS states and Canadian provinces with container deposits\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Container_deposit_legislation_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: US states and Canadian provinces with container deposits\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Container-deposit_legislation_in_US_and_Canadian_states.svg/330px-Container-deposit_legislation_in_US_and_Canadian_states.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Container-deposit_legislation_in_US_and_Canadian_states.svg)\n\n[Container-deposit legislation](/wiki/Container-deposit_legislation \"Container-deposit legislation\") in North America. \n\nContainer deposits on most bottles and cans\n\nContainer deposits only on beer/alcoholic beverage containers\n\nContainer deposits discontinued\n\nNo container deposits\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Canned_wine.jpg/250px-Canned_wine.jpg)](/wiki/File:Canned_wine.jpg)\n\nCanned wine with Iowa 5\u00a2 and Maine 15\u00a2 insignia\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/EVEN_THE_PROSPECT_OF_A_FIVE_CENT_REFUND_PER_%22THROWAWAY%22_ALUMINUM_CAN_IN_OREGON_HAS_NOT_STOPPED_LITTERING_ENTIRELY...._-_NARA_-_555257.jpg/250px-EVEN_THE_PROSPECT_OF_A_FIVE_CENT_REFUND_PER_%22THROWAWAY%22_ALUMINUM_CAN_IN_OREGON_HAS_NOT_STOPPED_LITTERING_ENTIRELY...._-_NARA_-_555257.jpg)](/wiki/File:EVEN_THE_PROSPECT_OF_A_FIVE_CENT_REFUND_PER_%22THROWAWAY%22_ALUMINUM_CAN_IN_OREGON_HAS_NOT_STOPPED_LITTERING_ENTIRELY...._-_NARA_-_555257.jpg)\n\nCans discarded less than two years after the [Oregon Bottle Bill](/wiki/Oregon_Bottle_Bill \"Oregon Bottle Bill\") was passed.\n\n* [California](/wiki/California \"California\") (5\u00a2; for bottles 24\u00a0U.S.\u00a0fl\u00a0oz (710\u00a0mL) or greater, 10\u00a2; boxed wine, wine pouches and cartons 25\u00a2), California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act (AB 2020) implemented in 1987, last revision made January 2024.

The sales tax is not refunded to consumers upon redeeming the empty containers to a recycling center. Some recycling centers have attracted drug activity and crimes. In one example in [Haight-Ashbury](/wiki/Haight-Ashbury \"Haight-Ashbury\"), a recycling center was ordered shut down by the city in 2012 due to drug activity crime.[[11]](#cite_note-11)\n* [Connecticut](/wiki/Connecticut \"Connecticut\") (10\u00a2).

The customer creates an account and drop off bags filled with cans and receive the deposit into their account after the containers have been counted.[[24]](#cite_note-24)[[25]](#cite_note-:1-25) In October 2019, a CLYNK customer complained to [WGME-TV](/wiki/WGME-TV \"WGME-TV\") alleging that CLYNK counted incorrectly four out of five times.

Overall redemption rates as of 2007 were 66%; 76% for beer, 56.6% for soda, and 64.7% for wine product. Redemption limit is 240 containers per person, per day, but this can be circumvented by notifying the business at least 48 hours in advance, in which case the business is compelled to take any amount. In addition, any store that sells a product with a deposit, is required to take it back and refund the deposit.[[35]](#cite_note-35) As of March 2010, all business which sell beverages in beverages containers for consumption off site and are part of a chain of businesses of 10 or more under common ownership are required to install 3\u20138 reverse vending machines on their premises depending on area of the business.[[36]](#cite_note-36) In 2024, New York proposed a bill that will increase the bottle deposit from 5\u00a2 to 10\u00a2.[[37]](#cite_note-37)\n* [Oregon](/wiki/Oregon \"Oregon\") (10\u00a2), the [Oregon Bottle Bill](/wiki/Oregon_Bottle_Bill \"Oregon Bottle Bill\") passed in 1971.

Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nHow many at bats did the Yankee with the most walks in the 1977 regular season have that same season?"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "**Thought:** To find out how many at bats the Yankee with the most walks in the 1977 regular season had, we first need to determine which Yankee player had the most walks during that season.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results.

Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nCompute the check digit the Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales would have if it were an ISBN-10 number."}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Thought: To compute the check digit for the Tropicos ID as if it were an ISBN-10 number, we need to follow these steps:\n1.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

part of the [MBTA Commuter Rail](/wiki/MBTA_Commuter_Rail \"MBTA Commuter Rail\") system. It runs from [Boston](/wiki/Boston \"Boston\")'s [South Station](/wiki/South_Station \"South Station\") in a southwesterly direction toward [Franklin, Massachusetts](/wiki/Franklin,_Massachusetts \"Franklin, Massachusetts\"). Most weekday trains use the [Northeast Corridor](/wiki/Northeast_Corridor \"Northeast Corridor\") before splitting off onto the namesake **Franklin Branch** at [Readville](/wiki/Readville \"Readville\"), though some weekday trains and all weekend trains use the Dorchester Branch ([Fairmount Line](/wiki/Fairmount_Line \"Fairmount Line\")) between Boston and Readville.\n\n[Foxboro station](/wiki/Foxboro_station \"Foxboro station\") is located on [the Framingham Secondary](/wiki/Framingham_Secondary \"Framingham Secondary\") branch line, which connects with the Franklin Line at Walpole. Previously, trains only served the station during special events at [Gillette Stadium](/wiki/Gillette_Stadium \"Gillette Stadium\"). Pilot weekday service to Foxboro ran from October 2019 to November 2020; it resumed in May 2022 and was made permanent in October 2023.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Franklin/Foxboro_Line&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Walpole_Union_Station%2C_Walpole_MA.jpg/250px-Walpole_Union_Station%2C_Walpole_MA.jpg)](/wiki/File:Walpole_Union_Station,_Walpole_MA.jpg)\n\nUnion Station in Walpole\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Forge_Park_495_station_platforms_and_building%2C_May_2017.JPG/250px-Forge_Park_495_station_platforms_and_building%2C_May_2017.JPG)](/wiki/File:Forge_Park_495_station_platforms_and_building,_May_2017.JPG)\n\nThe line was extended to Forge Park/495 station in 1988\n\nThe earliest predecessor to the Franklin Line began in 1835 when the [Boston and Providence Railroad](/wiki/Boston_and_Providence_Railroad \"Boston and Providence Railroad\") built a branch from [Dedham](/wiki/Dedham,_Massachusetts \"Dedham, Massachusetts\") to [Readville](/wiki/Readville,_Massachusetts \"Readville, Massachusetts\"), connecting with the main line from [Boston](/wiki/Boston \"Boston\") to [Providence](/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island \"Providence, Rhode Island\"). This was followed, in 1848, by the Norfolk County Railroad, which ran from Dedham to [Walpole](/wiki/Walpole,_Massachusetts \"Walpole, Massachusetts\").[[3]](#cite_note-3) After various mergers and acquisitions, the line become part of the [New York and New England Railroad](/wiki/New_York_and_New_England_Railroad \"New York and New England Railroad\") until 1898, the [New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad](/wiki/New_York,_New_Haven_and_Hartford_Railroad \"New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad\") until 1968, and, ultimately, [Penn Central](/wiki/Penn_Central \"Penn Central\") until its 1970 bankruptcy.\n\nWhat is today's Franklin Branch was a portion of the Midland Line of the New Haven's [Midland Division](/w/index.php?title=Midland_Division_(NYNH%26H)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Midland Division (NYNH&H) (page does not exist)\"), the New Haven's secondary route between Boston and New York; the MBTA's Dorchester Branch and the abandoned segments from Franklin to [Willimantic, Connecticut](/wiki/Willimantic,_Connecticut \"Willimantic, Connecticut\") via [Blackstone](/wiki/Blackstone,_Massachusetts \"Blackstone, Massachusetts\") were the remaining components of the Midland Line. In 1910, the passenger route on the Midland Line was a [regional inter-city train](/wiki/Regional_rail \"Regional rail\") that continued to New York via the Highland Line segment of the [Highland Division](/w/index.php?title=Highland_Division_(NYNH%26H)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Highland Division (NYNH&H) (page does not exist)\") between Willimantic and [Waterbury, Connecticut](/wiki/Waterbury,_Connecticut \"Waterbury, Connecticut\"), then continuing down the [Housatonic Railroad](/wiki/Housatonic_Railroad \"Housatonic Railroad\") to the [New Haven Line](/wiki/New_Haven_Line \"New Haven Line\").[[4]](#cite_note-4) Service was eventually shortened to Waterbury in 1937.[[5]](#cite_note-5)\n\nHowever, in the 1940s and early 1950s service, including the New Haven's *[Nutmeg](/wiki/Nutmeg_(train) \"Nutmeg (train)\")* and several unnamed trains from Boston to Hartford and Waterbury continued.[[6]](#cite_note-6) It was shortened to Blackstone when the two southern spans of the bridge crossing the [Quinebaug River](/wiki/Quinebaug_River \"Quinebaug River\") in [Putnam, Connecticut](/wiki/Putnam,_Connecticut \"Putnam, Connecticut\") washed out during [Hurricane Diane](/wiki/Hurricane_Diane \"Hurricane Diane\") in [1955](/wiki/1955_Atlantic_hurricane_season \"1955 Atlantic hurricane season\"). The bridge was never repaired, and the line was abandoned between Willimantic and Putnam in 1959.\n\n### MBTA era\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Franklin/Foxboro_Line&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: MBTA era\")]\n\nService to Blackstone was discontinued in April 1966 when the MBTA began subsidizing the line; Franklin and beyond were not in the MBTA district, meaning that the towns themselves had to subsidize service, and only Franklin agreed to do so.[[7]](#cite_note-netransit-7) The easternmost bridge over the Blackstone River was washed out in the March 17-19th flooding of the river in 1968; the line beyond Franklin was abandoned 3 years later,[[8]](#cite_note-woonsocket-8) and is now preserved in full as the [Southern New England Trunkline Trail](/wiki/Southern_New_England_Trunkline_Trail \"Southern New England Trunkline Trail\"). Between 1973 and 1976, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts bought almost all track assets in Southeastern Massachusetts, including the Franklin Branch, from the Penn Central's bankruptcy trustees. Ridership on the line tripled from 1982 to 1990.[[9]](#cite_note-9)\n\nFrom the start of MBTA operations, [Franklin](/wiki/Franklin/Dean_College_station \"Franklin/Dean College station\") was the terminus of the line. Service was extended to [Forge Park/495 station](/wiki/Forge_Park/495_station \"Forge Park/495 station\") on June 2, 1988, although the line retained its original name.[[10]](#cite_note-howe-10)[[7]](#cite_note-netransit-7) Forge Park/495 is not on the former NY&NE main line to Woonsocket, but instead on the former [Milford and Woonsocket Railroad](/wiki/Milford_and_Woonsocket_Railroad \"Milford and Woonsocket Railroad\"), which last saw passenger service in 1938.[[11]](#cite_note-sne-11) The MBTA leased the branch from [Conrail](/wiki/Conrail \"Conrail\") for the extension, with the possibility of future purchase.[[7]](#cite_note-netransit-7) In February 2020, the MBTA voted to purchase the line from Franklin to Milford for $13 million.[[12]](#cite_note-12)\n\n### Double tracking\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Franklin/Foxboro_Line&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Double tracking\")]\n\nIn early 2019, the MBTA begin installation of an additional 3.8 miles (6.1\u00a0km) of double track - 3.3 miles (5.3\u00a0km) of new track plus the conversion of an existing siding) - between [Walpole](/wiki/Union_Station_(Walpole,_Massachusetts) \"Union Station (Walpole, Massachusetts)\") and [Norfolk](/wiki/Norfolk_station_(MBTA) \"Norfolk station (MBTA)\").[[13]](#cite_note-fmcb-13) Major construction was completed in April 2020.[[14]](#cite_note-14) The $30 million construction of an additional phase and preliminary design of a third were announced in November 2019.

The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\")\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nOn ScienceDirect, what is the difference to 3 decimal places in the sample standard deviations of the number of Reference Works in each Life Science domain compared to Health Sciences as of 2022?"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "**Thought:** To find the sample standard deviations of the number of Reference Works in each Life Science domain and Health Sciences on ScienceDirect, we'll need to:\n\n1.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Let's compute the result using python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string, filter_year: integer) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n        filter_year: Optionally restrict results to a certain year\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"}], "tool_calls": null, "raw": null, "token_usage": null}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "New task:\nOf the cities within the United States where U.S. presidents were born, which two are the farthest apart from the westernmost to the easternmost going east, giving the city names only?
